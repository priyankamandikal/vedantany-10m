    "a": " Based on Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture on Vedantasara, it seems that Advaita Vedanta does not fully agree with the Kashmir Shaivism perspective on Chit being both Prakasha and Vimarsha as part of the ultimate reality.\n\nIn Advaita Vedanta, Chit is considered to be self-luminous or Prakasha, which is the light or awareness. However, self-reflectivity or Vimarsha, which is the awareness of that awareness, is not considered to be part of the ultimate reality. According to Advaita Vedanta, Vimarsha may come, stay, or disappear, but it is not essential to the nature of Brahman.\n\nTherefore, while Kashmir Shaivism views both Prakasha and Vimarsha as integral to the ultimate reality, Advaita Vedanta only considers Prakasha to be a fundamental aspect of the ultimate reality, with Vimarsha being a secondary or subsequent aspect.",

Shankaracharya says that even then isness is there, but there is no way of experiencing it anymore. It is analogous to what you are asking. That is from the isness perspective, you are asking from consciousness perspective. Okay, thank you very much. Technically, the straight answer to your question will be, Kashmiri Shaivism holds on to vimarsha, apart from prakasha. Prakasha is light or awareness. Vimarsha is awareness of that awareness. And so, according to Kashmiri Shaivism, that vimarsha also is part of the ultimate reality. Prakasha, vimarsha, swaroopa. Advaita Vedanta says, prakasha, swaroopa. Vimarsha, self-reflectivity, will come later on. And that may come, stay, disappear. It is nothing to you, the Brahman. Thank you. Thank you. Alright, it's a good point to end this discussion. Thank you."
