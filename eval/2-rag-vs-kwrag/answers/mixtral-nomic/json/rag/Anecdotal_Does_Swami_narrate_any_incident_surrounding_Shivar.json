    "a": " In the provided passage, Swami Sarvapriyananda shares an incident involving Swami Shivamayanji, but it does not explicitly mention Shivaratri. However, the narrative does offer insights into the experiences and teachings of the swamis.\n\nAccording to the passage, Swami Shivamayanji once told a group of young monks, including Swami Sarvapriyananda, about an experience he had with his guru, Swami Gambhirananda. Swami Gambhirananda, at the time a vice president and later president of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, was describing the nature of God realization. He explained that the living form of the chosen deity appears in one's heart as a blazing or flaming form (Bengali: Amin jakhoni chok bhoji. Ishta murti. Jaljal kare bhaveshe othe). Swami Gambhirananda further emphasized the importance of realizing Brahman in all beings, indicating a deep understanding and connection with the divine in everything and everyone.\n\nSwami Shivamayanji used this story to teach the young monks about the expectations of people who show respect and reverence to them. He wanted to remind them of the importance of their conduct and the impact they have on others.\n\nWhile this narrative does not directly mention Shivaratri, it does provide a glimpse into the teachings and values of the swamis, which likely influenced their celebrations and observations of various Hindu festivals, including Shivaratri.",

Not imagined. Not just visualized. That blazes forth. Of course he didn't explain all this. He just said in Bengali. Bhagavan lab bolte tumi ki bojo. What do you mean? What exactly do you mean by God realization? He said in Bengali. Amin jakhoni chok bhoji. Ishta murti. Jaljal kare bhaveshe othe. Bengali. It would just simply mean. It's like a flaming form or a blazing form. Of the. Ishta Devata. Appears in my heart. Next he said. But is this all? One has to realize Brahman in all beings. Bengali he said. So imagine. That was Swami Gambhiranji. Long time before he actually became the vice president. And the president. Anyway Swami Shivamayanji told us this incident. And then he looked at us. The young monks present there. And he said. Look this is what people expect. When they bow down to you. And touch your feet. And call you know like this. Or show you so much respect. This is what people expect. This is what they want. In a moment to see in a monk. So never forget that. So it's really ingrained in my memory. That incident. I can still see him looking at straight at us. And telling us. He is a wonderful monk. Swami Shivamayanji. You have so many wonderful incidents to share about. Humorous, straightforward, very simple. One little incident shows the heart of the man. He must have been in the 60s at that"
