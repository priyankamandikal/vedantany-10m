    "a": " Sadhana Chatushtaya, also known as the fourfold qualification, is a set of qualities that are necessary for entering into the study of Advaita Vedanta. These qualifications are discussed in the Vedantasara text and are considered essential for any serious seeker of truth. The four qualifications are:\n\n1. Viveka: Discrimination between the real and the unreal. This means having the ability to distinguish between what is eternal and unchanging (the Self) and what is transient and ever-changing (the world).\n2. Vairagya: Dispassion or renunciation of the world. This means developing a detachment from worldly desires and attachments, and a desire for liberation.\n3. Shatsampat: The sixfold virtues. These include:\n\t* Shama: Control of the mind\n\t* Dama: Control of the senses\n\t",
