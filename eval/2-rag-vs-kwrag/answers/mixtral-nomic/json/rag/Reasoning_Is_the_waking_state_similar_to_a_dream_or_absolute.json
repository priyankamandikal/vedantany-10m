    "q": "Is the waking state similar to a dream or absolutely indistinguishable from the dream state?",
    "c": "Explanatory",
    "k": "indistinguishable, dream state, waking state similar",
    "a": " The waking state is not absolutely indistinguishable from the dream state, as there are differences between the two. However, the dream state can be considered similar to a waking state for the dreamer. In both states, the objects and experiences felt by the individual are perceived as real and permanent within their respective contexts. The key distinction lies in the feeling of permanence and consistency of objects and experiences.\n\nIn the waking state, objects and experiences are generally consistent and remain the same from one instance to another, leading the individual to perceive them as real and permanent. On the other hand, in the dream state, the objects and experiences change from one dream to another, but they still feel real and permanent while the dream is occurring.\n\nSwami Sarvapriyananda explains that Advaita Vedanta takes a balanced and nuanced approach to this question. While there are similarities between the waking and dream states, such as the perception of reality and permanence, there are also differences that set them apart. The perception of one's relatives in both states serves as an example of this nuanced view. In both the waking and dream states, relatives are perceived as real by the individual experiencing them. However, Advaita Vedanta does not diminish the reality of waking state relatives by comparing them to dream state relatives, which could be considered mere ideas or thoughts. Instead, it acknowledges the relative reality of both experiences, without fully equating the two states.",

            "content": "different. Not only every night, from every dream to dream it's different. Answer in reply, the dream state is a waking state for the dreamer. As has already been pointed out. And one knows a state to be a waking state only when there is a feeling that the objects seen are real and as such remain the same in all waking states. The answer is, in the dream state, in a dream when you see objects, they are not felt to be temporary and about to disappear at the end of this dream. They feel felt to be absolutely real. My friend feels real. The table, chair I'm sitting with feels real. The food I eat feels as real as necessary. They don't feel temporary. Just as these ones seem pretty permanent, the dream objects also seem pretty permanent in the dream. Ninth, if the objects of the waking state are exactly like those of the dream state, then our beloved friends, kith and kin, would be no more than ideas, like those of our dream world relatives. Such an attitude is repugnant to our feelings. The reply is that our relatives seen in the waking or the dream state, again a very subtle and powerful answer, are as real as the I, as you yourself. What you consider yourself as real as the waker considers himself to be, so real does the waker's world seem to be. As real as the dreamer considers himself or herself to be, so real does the dream world seem to be. Advaita's answer here is balanced and nuanced. Why? Because you know actually what Advaita wants to say is that, yes, your relatives"
