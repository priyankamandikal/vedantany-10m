    "a": " According to Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture on Vedantasara, the connection between Samadhi and enlightenment in Advaita Vedanta is a nuanced topic. While it is true that Ramakrishna attained nirvikalpa samadhi after being taught Advaita Vedanta by Totapuri, Swami Bhutesanandaji pointed out that there were elements of yoga present in this process as well. The method of using meditation to achieve samadhi, nirvikalpa samadhi, is a powerful tool for Vedantic meditation, known as nididhyasana.\n\nHowever, it is essential to understand the role of samadhi in enlightenment properly. Scholar Michael Comans criticized the Ramakrishna Mission for overemphasizing the importance of samadhi in Advaita Vedanta. Comans questions the connection by pointing out that Shankara, a significant Advaita Vedanta philosopher, rarely discusses samadhi in his writings.\n\nIn summary, while samadhi is an essential component of the spiritual journey in Advaita Vedanta, it may not be as crucial to enlightenment as is often perceived. The teachings of Shankara suggest that other practices, such as self-inquiry and understanding the nature of the Self (Atman) and Brahman, might play a more central role in the pursuit of enlightenment in Advaita Vedanta.",

And so we always, these two go in our minds together, Advaita Vedanta, nirvikalpa samadhi. This was asked to Bhutesanandaji. And then what was his reply? He said, That was not just Vedanta, Advaita Vedanta. You have to understand, there's elements of yoga were also present there. When he said after Vedantic teaching, you use meditation to attain samadhi, nirvikalpa samadhi. Good, that's yoga teaching and that's used by Vedantins. It's very powerful method for nididhyasana, Vedantic meditation. These two questions are sort of lost in all the discussions, but these are very important. When you have questions about the role of samadhi in enlightenment, is it necessary? Yes, but you must understand in what sense it is necessary. Practically, very much so. But not what you might think that after that kind of thing, then only I will become enlightened. No. All right. That's the rant. There have been papers written on it. I mean, there's a lot of background in my mind, why I'm saying these things. Papers written on it. Michael Comans, for example, he says the role of samadhi in Advaita Vedanta, blaming us, the Ramakrishna Mission, for overemphasizing samadhi. He says, where in all of Shankara's writing, where does Shankara talk about samadhi? Almost never. So what are you guys talking about when you talk about samadhi? Now, why I'm saying this is, it's a very complicated issue. You"
