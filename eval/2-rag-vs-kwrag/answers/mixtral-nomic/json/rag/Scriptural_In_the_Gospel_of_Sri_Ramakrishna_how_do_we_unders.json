    "a": " In the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa uses the analogy of a salt doll to explain the nature of the self and its realization. However, the passage provided does not explicitly mention this analogy. Nevertheless, I can provide an answer based on Swami Sarvapriyananda's teachings about the nature of the Atman and Ramakrishna's perspective on self-realization.\n\nThe salt doll analogy is not directly related to the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna passage you provided, but it is a well-known teaching from Ramakrishna that helps illustrate the concept of the self and its realization. In this analogy, Ramakrishna compares the self to a salt doll that goes to measure the depth of the ocean. As the doll gradually immerses itself in the water, it eventually dissolves, and the water becomes salty. Similarly, when a person seeks to understand the nature of the self and reality, they eventually realize that the self is not separate from the divine reality (Brahman) \u2013 it is one and the same. In this process, the individual ego or sense of separate self dissolves, just like the salt doll.\n\nIn the passage you provided, Swami Sarvapriyananda explains that Ramakrishna revealed the nature of the Atman to Swami Vivekananda, stating that the Atman is immortal, eternal, and unchanging. This teaching aligns with the salt doll analogy, as both emphasize the dissolution of the individual self and the realization of the true, immortal nature of the Atman.\n\nIn summary, while the passage does not explicitly mention the salt doll analogy, it is still relevant to the understanding of the self and its realization in the teachings of Ramakrishna. The salt doll analogy illustrates the dissolution of the individual self and the realization of the immortal and eternal nature of the Atman, which is consistent with the teachings provided in the passage.",

And all your future too I know. Is it not so? Suddenly it comes like that. And what comes over M at that time, the author, he bows down with his hands folded and says, yes Lord, you know. That is the difference between man and God. So here Sri Krishna points that out. But here he says in a purely Vedantic sense. That means here basically he is saying we are Atman. We are that existence consciousness bliss. Here he is revealing for the first time the nature of the Atman. What is the nature of the Atman? The first thing, it is immortal, it is eternal, it is unchanging. It is not born with the birth of the body. It does not age with the aging of the body. It does not die with the death of the body. He does not say you, he does not say it. He says you were not born with the birth of the body. You do not age with the aging of the body. You do not die with the death of the body. Many times bodies have come and gone. Many lives you have lived, many names you have had. But you continue. So the Atman, the first thing about the Atman is that it is immortal. The teaching about, central teaching about Vedanta. Sri Ramakrishna when he told Swami Vivekananda, the famous incident where he told Swami Vivekananda that he who was Rama, he who was Krishna is in this body Ramakrishna. But not in your Vedantic sense. He told Swami"
