    "a": " The Mundaka Upanishad, one of the core texts of Vedanta, contains the parable of the two birds as described in the third chapter, 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. In this parable, there are two birds sitting on a tree. One bird is lower, while the other is higher. The lower bird represents the individual human being, who hops from branch to branch, which symbolizes our lives as we experience them now. This lower bird is engaged in the world, moving from one experience to another, tasting the \"fruits\" of various experiences, seeking happiness and satisfaction.\n\nThe higher bird, on the other hand, represents the divine or higher self, which remains uninvolved and merely observes the activities of the lower bird. This higher bird is not affected by the ups and downs of life, always remaining in a state of peace and bliss.\n\nThe interpretation of this parable is that our true nature is the higher bird, the divine self, which is untouched by the world and its experiences. However, we often identify ourselves with the lower bird, the individual self, and become entangled in the world and its dualities. The goal of spiritual life, according to Vedanta, is to realize our true nature as the higher bird, the divine self, and attain spiritual freedom. This can be achieved through practices such as meditation, self-inquiry, and selfless service, which help us disidentify with the lower bird and identify with the higher bird. By doing so, we can move from the unreal (the individual self) to the real (the divine self), from darkness (ignorance) to light (knowledge), and from death (limited existence) to immortality (unlimited existence).",

The subject we have this morning before us is a very familiar subject to those who have been in Vedanta for a long time. It's the metaphor of the two birds. The subject is the two birds and how this thing, this whole concept of a tree and two birds sitting on it, it encapsulates our life as we experience it now, the possibility of spiritual freedom and how we can get that spiritual freedom and what we get out of it. All of that beautifully the two birds. So let's go straight into the subject. The reference is to the Mundaka Upanishads. The Upanishads we know are the core texts of Vedanta and in the Mundaka Upanishads, one of the most ancient of the Upanishads, in the third chapter 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 we find this thing described using the metaphor of the two birds and the tree. The original verses, the mantras go like this. I'll chant them out for you in the old Vedic Sanskrit and then I'll translate and then we'll go into it. So it goes something like this. Very poetic. What does it mean? There's a tree and on this tree there are two birds, the lower bird and the higher bird and what the lower bird does is it hops from branch to branch and looks at different fruits and picks one and finds it sweet, eats it up, looks for another one, picks it,"
