    "a": " Christopher Isherwood was a British-born novelist and playwright who made significant contributions to the understanding and promotion of Vedanta. He was close to Swami Nikhilananda, an influential Vedanta teacher, and through this connection, he became deeply interested in Vedanta philosophy. Isherwood became a serious student of Vedanta and even served as an editor for Swami Nikhilananda's translation of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nIsherwood's contribution to Vedanta is not \"unknown\" as the passage suggests, but it is indeed less known compared to other aspects of his life and work. A simple internet search for \"Star Wars Vedanta\" or \"Christopher Isherwood Vedanta\" will yield numerous results connecting him to the philosophy.\n\nIn the passage, Swami Sarvapriyananda mentions the control of the sense organs, particularly the ears, and how people often want to hear what others are saying about them. Isherwood's experience as a new monk, as described in the passage, demonstrates his understanding and practice of this Vedanta principle. He chose not to listen to people talking about him, showing his commitment to the teachings of Vedanta.\n\nIn summary, Christopher Isherwood's contribution to Vedanta includes his dedicated study, his role as an editor for Swami Nikhilananda's works, and his personal practice of Vedanta principles.",

            "content": "Maybe. Might be. Jackie Kennedy was the editor of that book. OK, OK. So, but he was close to Nikhil Ananda and got many of the ideas of Vedanta from him. But it's not all that unknown because I googled it recently. I said that and then I thought maybe I should check up on that. And I googled it. It's fairly pretty well known. You will immediately get hits if you say Star Wars Vedanta. And immediately you'll get Joseph Campbell and George Lucas and Vedanta and you'll get that on the net. So control of the sense organs, the eyes, the ears want to hear something. They want to. You know, one of the things with the ears want to hear is what people are saying about me. Immediately we want to listen. Yes, what did he say about me? If he says something good, I'm happy. Especially if they're saying something bad, I'm anxious about it. What are they saying about me? I remember when I was a new, I was a brahmachari, a new monk, a novice. Once I was walking with a senior Swami in Deogarh where I joined. And instead of taking the usual path, there were people standing at the end of the road. The Swami, he said, let's take this path. I said, why? Because they are talking about me. I don't want to, I don't want to go down that path and disturb them. Let them talk. Let's go by this way. You see, because they are talking about me, I will not listen. Let them talk. Dhamma, control of the sense organs. Uparati. Once you have quietened the mind and the sense organs down, don't let it go, you"
