    "a": " In Vedantasara, as explained by Swami Sarvapriyananda, both Phala Vyapti and Vritti Vyapti are crucial concepts related to the process of acquiring knowledge.\n\nVritti Vyapti refers to the function that destroys ignorance about an object. In any knowledge-acquiring process, when one is ignorant about something (x), Vritti Vyapti is the means to eliminate this ignorance. For instance, if one wants to know what is behind them and currently lacks this knowledge due to ignorance, they need to create a Vritti Vyapti. This can be achieved by using their senses, such as looking around or using other relevant means, to form a mental impression (Vritti) about the object hidden by ignorance. Once the Vritti Vyapti is established, the reflected consciousness in the mind will illuminate the revealed object, leading to the acquisition of knowledge about the object.\n\nPhala Vyapti, on the other hand, is the function that reveals or illuminates the object once the ignorance is removed by Vritti Vyapti. In other words, Phala Vyapti is the manifestation of knowledge about the object, following the destruction of ignorance through Vritti Vyapti.\n\nTo summarize, Vritti Vyapti is the process of eliminating ignorance about an object through the creation of a mental impression, while Phala Vyapti is the subsequent manifestation of knowledge about the object once the ignorance is removed.",

            "content": "had a nice feast of self-knowledge. And they burped. And that burp was the Upanishads. So I am going to come down to say these are the expressions of the realizations of the rishis. But I never thought that this most august and ancient and sacred of scriptures would be described as a burp. So all right. Now what happens? One more point to be noted. What exactly is the function of vritti-vyapti? What exactly is the function of phala-vyapti? In any knowledge, the function of vritti-vyapti is to destroy the ignorance about that object. So I want to know x. Right now I'm ignorant about x. Why? For example, what is behind me right now? Maybe you can see, but I can't see. So I need to, I'm ignorant about it, what is behind me. So in one way I can put it that what is behind me is covered by ignorance for me. How do I remove that ignorance? I have to create a vritti-vyapti. How do I create the vritti-vyapti? I have to look around and use my eyes and see what is there behind me. That creates a vritti about the thing which is behind me and it removes the ignorance about that. Simultaneously what happens is the reflected consciousness in the mind will illumine the revealed object and I will get the knowledge that I see what's there. So vritti-vyapti destroys ignorance, phala-vyapti reveals or illumines the object. I'll repeat again. Objects are hidden to us. The vritti-vyapti destroys the ignorance. Hidden by what? Hidden by ignorance. Vritti-vyapti destroys ignorance, phala-vyapti"
