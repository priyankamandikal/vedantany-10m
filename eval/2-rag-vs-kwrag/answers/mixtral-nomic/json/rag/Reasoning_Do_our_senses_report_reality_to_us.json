    "a": " According to Swami Sarvapriyananda and the perspective of Advaita Vedanta, our senses may not report reality to us as it is. This idea is supported by modern cognitive scientists who are leaning towards the notion that consciousness is fundamental and there is a deeper reality in the world than what our senses tell us.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, Swami Sarvapriyananda uses the examples of a honeybee and a bat. A honeybee has a strong nasal sensory system that guides it to the source of honey, while a bat has sound receptacles that help it detect danger and locate its prey. These animals do not perceive the world as humans do, which raises the question of whether our perception of reality is accurate or complete.\n\nThe Swami further explains that our senses have evolved to ensure our survival and well-being, rather than to provide an accurate representation of the world. In other words, our senses report a version of reality that is tailored to our needs and limitations as biological organisms. This does not necessarily mean that our perception is false, but it may not be a complete or accurate representation of the underlying reality.\n\nIn summary, based on Swami Sarvapriyananda's teachings and the findings of modern cognitive science, our senses may not report reality to us as it is. Instead, they provide a version of reality that is shaped by our evolutionary history and biological limitations.",

We have a wide internet audience all over the world, and they send in a lot of questions, only a few of which we can answer. They are selected. And there are also questions from the live audience. So we'll start off with some questions from the internet audience. Yes. This first question is from. Are the questions audible? Yes. This first question is from Ajoy. Modern cognitive scientists are veering more and more towards the idea that consciousness is fundamental, and there is a deeper reality in the world than our senses tell us. A honeybee has a strong nasal sensory system that takes it to the source of honey. Similarly, a bat has sound receptacles that allow it to sense danger and also find its prey. They also do not see the world as we see it. Therefore, is it not a legitimate question to ask, how correct are we to presume that what we see is indeed the reality? How can we say our sensory organs tell us the truth? Can you give us a Vedantic perspective to it and how Advaita Vedanta sees such developments? You're right. It's very interesting. As Ajoy has written, that's true. Our senses, do they report the truth to us? Do they report reality to us? And the conclusion of modern cognitive science and indeed even evolutionary science is that they do not. The senses do not report reality to us. What do you mean by that? So are they"
