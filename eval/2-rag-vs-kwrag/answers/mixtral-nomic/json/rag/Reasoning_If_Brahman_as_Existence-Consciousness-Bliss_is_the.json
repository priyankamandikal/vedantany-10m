    "q": "If Brahman as Existence-Consciousness-Bliss is the eternal subject that cannot be objectified, yet eternally reveals itself to give rise to apparent objects through the principle of Maya, can we infer that Brahman is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss-Maya? That is, is Brahman inseparable from Maya?",
    "c": "Reasoning",
    "k": "maya, brahman inseparable",
    "a": " Based on Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture, the answer to your question is that Brahman is not inseparable from Maya. While it is true that Brahman, as the eternal subject and Existence-Consciousness-Bliss, cannot be objectified and eternally reveals itself, it does not mean that Brahman is inseparable from Maya.\n\nMaya is the principle that obscures the distinction between Brahman and the world of names and forms. It hides the true nature of Brahman by projecting a network of names and forms over it, making us perceive an existing universe instead of pure existence. However, Maya does not affect or taint Brahman itself.\n\nBrahman remains untouched, pure, and unchanging, while Maya is the power that creates the illusion of separation and distinction. Therefore, Brahman is not Existence-Consciousness-Bliss-Maya, as Maya is not an inherent quality of Brahman but rather a power that arises from it.\n\nIn summary, Brahman is not inseparable from Maya, as Brahman remains untouched and pure, while Maya is the power that obscures the true nature of Brahman and creates the illusion of an existing universe.",

And those names and forms have derived existence from Brahman, just as this table derives existence from the wood and the names and forms and the Brahman, the existence, pure existence, which is the ground of those names and forms. The distinction between the two has been obscured by the obscuring power of maya, avarana As a result, what we see is an existing universe. Existence belongs to Brahman. Universe is just name and form, but we do not see it separately. We see an existing universe out there. Consciousness belongs to you or me as the witness, as a pure consciousness. And that is projected as a subtle body by the power, projecting power of maya. But we do not experience ourselves like that. What we experience ourselves as is a conscious mind. Consciousness, witness, mind, subtle body, but we do not experience that way. We experience as a conscious mind. So the distinction between the no word, pramata and sakshi, witness, insight, the distinction between Brahman and the world of names and forms, this distinction is obscured by the power of maya. I know what some people have a quizzical expression on their face and the question might be, isn't it that the Brahman is obscured by maya? No, Brahman cannot be hidden. Brahman cannot be hidden. The difference between Brahman and the world outside is obscured by maya. The difference between Brahman or sakshi insight and"
