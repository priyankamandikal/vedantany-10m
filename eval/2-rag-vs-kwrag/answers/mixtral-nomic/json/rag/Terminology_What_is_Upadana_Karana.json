    "a": " Upadana Karana, in the context of Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture on the Bhagavad Gita, refers to the material cause. It is the material from which something is made. In the lecture, Swami Sarvapriyananda explains that Upadana Karana, when referring to the universe, is God or Brahman with attributes (Saguna Brahman). This means that the universe is made of this intelligent cause, which is the creator, preserver, and destroyer of the world. However, it's important to note that when discussing the world as an appearance, only Brahman is, and this is referred to as Nirguna Brahman. Both Saguna Brahman and Nirguna Brahman are the same reality, but they are not equal realities. The personality, body, and mind are the appearance or transactional aspect, while pure consciousness is the truth about oneself.",

God, it's the material cause, upadana karana. Who made this universe? God. So this is, who are we talking about? Saguna brahman, brahman with attributes. The creator, preserver, and destroyer of the world. What is, but if you say the world is an appearance, only god is, or only brahman is, then you're talking about nirguna brahman. Are the two the same? Yes. In eighth chapter and ninth chapter, it's not talking about two different things. Eighth chapter is talking about the god of religion, saguna brahman. Ninth chapter is talking about the deeper reality of the same god. Just as, when I talk of you as a person, and when I say talk, I try to point out that you are pure consciousness. I'm not talking about two different people. I'm not talking about something called pure consciousness, something called a person. I'm talking about the same reality. The surface of it is a person. Upon investigation, it's pure consciousness. And they are not equal realities. Pure consciousness is the reality, is the truth about you. Your personality, body, mind is the appearance, is the transactional, like the part of the golden ornament. I want to read out a line from one of the greatest commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, greatest in the sense of sheer depth and extension and bulk. So this is Madhusudana Saraswati's, gudartadipika, the lamp which"
