    "a": " In the Mandukya Upanishad, the word 'Om' holds immense significance. It is considered to be a Mahavakya, a profound statement that encapsulates the ultimate truth. The Mahavakya in this Upanishad is \"I am Atma Brahma,\" which translates to \"This very self is Brahman.\" However, 'Om' is considered an even more concise way of conveying this same truth.\n\n'Om' is a symbol that represents the pure consciousness, the ultimate reality that is beyond the physical universe we know. It is a representation of the universe itself and all its manifestations. When you meditate on 'Om,' you are superimposing the idea of the universe and the divine onto the symbol, helping you connect with the pure consciousness.\n\nIn essence, 'Om' in the Mandukya Upanishad signifies the ultimate reality, the pure consciousness, and is used as a powerful symbol in meditation to connect with this reality.",

And in those texts also, the most concise way to convey that is the Mahavakya. You are Brahman. In this Upanishad we saw a Mahavakya. Do you remember what it is? I am Atma Brahma. This very self is Brahman. Even more concise way of conveying that same truth is Om. The final way, do you remember Kathopanishad, where the little boy goes to the Lord of Death and asks for the ultimate truth? And then what does the Lord of Death do? It's not Mandukya Upanishad. He has a lot of space to play about with. So the Lord of Death, Yama, tempts the boy and tries to divert him and then Nachiketa rejects all the temptations and finally says, I want to know that highest truth. And finally when Yama tells him the highest truth, you know how he tells him? What you are looking for is Om. And all of that is set aside in the Mandukya Upanishad. It just goes straight to the fact that it is Om. And what is Om? All these things. Yes, you can see that Om is basically, if you expand Om, you will come to these things. This is basically an account of the universe which we know and all of these things are used to point to something we do not know yet. The pure consciousness. The pure consciousness is represented by Om. One way of using Om is, the meditation is, the Hindu way of using symbols for spiritual concepts.
