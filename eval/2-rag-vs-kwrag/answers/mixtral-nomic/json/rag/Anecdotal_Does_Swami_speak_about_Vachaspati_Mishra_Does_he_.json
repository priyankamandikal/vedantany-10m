    "a": " Yes, Swami Sarvapriyananda does speak about Vachaspati Mishra in his lecture titled \"Vedantic Spirituality - Part 1\". Vachaspati Mishra was a significant figure in the Advaita Vedanta tradition who wrote the Bhamati, a commentary on Shankara's Brahma Sutra Bhashya. \n\nSwami Sarvapriyananda explains that there are two sub-schools of Advaita Vedanta: the Vivarana school, which follows the teachings of Padmapada Acharya, and the Bhamati school, which follows the interpretations of Vachaspati Mishra. \n\nHowever, Swami Sarvapriyananda does not explicitly narrate how the Bhamati was written or the circumstances surrounding its creation in this particular passage. The focus of this passage is on the differences between the Vivarana and Bhamati schools regarding the source of enlightenment. Vachaspati Mishra, according to the Bhamati school, believes that enlightenment comes from meditation on Vedantic statements, following a process of Shravana (hearing), Manana (reasoning), and Nididhyasana (meditation). In contrast, Padmapada Acharya, the founder of the Vivarana school, asserts that knowledge arises directly from the Upanishads, which are considered the Pramana, or source of knowledge, for the realization that one is Brahman. Meditation, in this view, is not a source of knowledge.\n\nIn summary, while Swami Sarvapriyananda does discuss Vachaspati Mishra and the Bhamati school, he does not delve into the specifics of how the Bhamati was written in this passage. The focus is on the differences between the Bhamati and Vivarana schools concerning the source of enlightenment.",

            "content": "Sutras. Vachaspati Mishra wrote this Bhamati. So there are two sub-schools of Advaita Vedanta. One is the school of Padmapada Acharya which came to be known as the Vivarana school. And the other one is the school of, which comes from the Bhamati interpretation given by Vachaspati Mishra, which came to be known as the Bhamati school. There are number of differences between the two approaches. But one difference is here. Where does enlightenment come from? Does enlightenment come from the Vedantic statement, that thou art, I am Brahma. Or does it come from meditation on those statements? Vachaspati Mishra says it comes from meditation. First Shravana, hearing. Second Manana, reasoning. Third Nididhyasana, meditation. And then from that comes the intuitive flash, Brahma Karavritti, you realize that you are Brahman. Padmapada Acharya said no. I said said but he actually precedes Vachaspati Mishra. He said that knowledge actually comes from the text. And there is a technical reason for this. Knowledge comes from Pramana. Pramana means source of knowledge. So eyes are the Pramana for what we see. Ears are the Pramana for the sound that we hear. Similarly for the realization that I am Brahman, Upanishads are the Pramana. So Pramana gives rise to knowledge. Source of knowledge gives rise to knowledge. Meditation according to Vedanta is not a source of knowledge. Upanishad is the source of knowledge. So Upanishad gives rise, the words give rise to direct knowledge. How? The example I"
