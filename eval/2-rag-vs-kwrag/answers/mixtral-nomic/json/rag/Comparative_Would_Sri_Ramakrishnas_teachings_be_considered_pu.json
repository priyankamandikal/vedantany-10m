    "a": " Based on the passage from Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture, Sri Ramakrishna's teachings cannot be considered purely Advaitic, even though they align with traditional Advaita in some aspects. Sri Ramakrishna emphasized realizing God by whatever means possible, and while he did base himself on Advaitic knowledge, he also placed tremendous emphasis on bhakti, or love of God. Swami Turiyananda, in a letter discussing Sri Ramakrishna's teachings, ultimately described them as \"realize God by whatever means possible,\" which goes beyond a single philosophical classification like Advaitic.",

Traditional Advaitin would find no fault in Sri Ramakrishna's sayings, would be happy with it. But then there are lots of things which Sri Ramakrishna said which cannot be so conveniently packaged away as traditional Advaita. Somebody, it's in the letters of Swami Turiyananda. I think it was Swami Sarvananda who wrote to Swami Turiyananda, what was the philosophy of Sri Ramakrishna? Somewhat like your question. Was he a non-dualist? Was he a qualified monist? Was he a dualist? Advaitin? Vishistha Advaitin? Advaitin or something else. It's a long reply which Swami Turiyananda has given, wonderful reply. It's worth reading. But he discusses various facets of what Sri Ramakrishna has taught. And then he says, but if you push me, so give me a straight answer. What is the philosophy of Sri Ramakrishna? Then he says, I will have to say the philosophy of Sri Ramakrishna is realize God by whatever means possible. In Bengali, it's even more direct. Jo sho kare bhagavan labh karo. By whatever means possible, realize God. That at the core seems to be what Sri Ramakrishna said. But he gave a lot of emphasis on Advaita because he said, base yourself on Advaitic knowledge and then practice whatever you want to practice. One of the things he said. But then he also put tremendous emphasis on bhakti, love of God. Good question. One more question from the internet audience now. Yes, we'll come to you. There"
