    "a": " In the Gospel, Sri Ramakrishna does not use a specific parable to portray intense longing for God. However, he often taught using parables and emphasized the importance of longing for God. One of his famous teachings is that God can be realized only by yearning for Him sincerely and intensely. He would explain this concept through various analogies and metaphors, but not specifically through a parable.\n\nIn the passage you provided, Swami Sarvapriyananda highlights the significance of parables in conveying the essence of teachings and mentions Sri Ramakrishna's preference for teaching in parables. However, the specific parable about intense longing for God is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nNonetheless, Sri Ramakrishna used a famous analogy to describe the intense longing for God. He compared it to a piece of salt dissolving in an ocean, saying that once the salt has dissolved, you can't find it anymore, but its taste is everywhere. Similarly, when a person longs for God with all their heart, they become one with the Divine, and the individual ego dissolves, just like the salt in the ocean.",

I have noticed that whenever I work a parable into my talks, afterwards it's the parable which people seem to like. They recall the parable and long afterwards when I meet people, they recall the parable, not the rest of the philosophy which I spoke about. So parables definitely stay in our mind and they convey the essence of the teaching very effectively, more than theory or anything else. And the gospel is full of parables, wonderful parables. Sri Ramakrishna taught, often taught in these wonderful parables. The gospel, my first impression of it when I was a kid, was it's so big. You know when you listen to the parable page 850 or something like that, that's one big book. And I used to see the small Bengali letters and the small print and this thick book. So when my grandmother told me, when I was a kid, long long ago, my grandmother told me that she had read the gospel 10 times. I was awestruck and I ran to tell my dad, that you know grandma has read this book 10 times. And he said, only 10 times? She's so old, she must be lazy. She should have read it many more times by now. When we approach the gospel, we take away certain things from it. The first thing that we are confronted with is the existence of God. One thing that leaps out of the pages of the gospel to us is that"
