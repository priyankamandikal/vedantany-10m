    "a": " The main difference between Buddhist Shunyavada, as presented by Nagarjuna, and Advaita Vedanta lies in their interpretations and the way they are perceived by traditional followers of each philosophy.\n\nTraditional Advaitins have often dismissed Shunyavada as nihilism, suggesting that it posits nothingness or the absence of existence. They argue that Nagarjuna's philosophy denies the existence of all things, which is an unfair characterization according to Swami Sarvapriyananda. In reality, Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti's texts clarify that they are not nihilists, and they do acknowledge the existence of various phenomena, albeit without an inherent self-existence or self-nature (svabhava).\n\nOn the other hand, modern Tibetan Buddhists and other Buddhist scholars sometimes misinterpret Advaita Vedanta by assuming that it posits the existence of a God-like, eternal substance or thing called Brahman. However, as Swami Sarvapriyananda explains, this is not an accurate representation of Advaita Vedanta. Gaudapada, a significant Advaita Vedanta figure, indeed asserts that the world is a mere appearance (vivarta) and not a real, separate entity (parinama). Nevertheless, this does not imply the existence of a separate, eternal substance like Brahman.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between Buddhist Shunyavada and Advaita Vedanta can be attributed to misinterpretations and oversimplifications by traditional followers on both sides. While traditional Advaitins accuse Shunyavada of nihilism, modern Tibetan Buddhists misunderstand Advaita Vedanta as believing in an eternal, God-like substance. In reality, both philosophies have more nuanced views on existence, self-nature, and ultimate reality.",

            "content": "it should be compared with this because other Buddhist schools are clearly different from Advaita Vedanta. Now, if you want to compare Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka with Advaita Vedanta, it's a very complicated and hotly debated topic for a long time now. Many, many views. I personally think, I'll just give you my take on it. I personally think the Advaitic view of Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka Shunyavada, the traditional view of Advaitins is misplaced. Traditional Advaitins have dismissed Nagarjuna's Shunyavada as nothing. They say nothing, as nihilism. But that is unfair. If you look at Nagarjuna's own texts and Chandrakirti's texts, they clearly say that we are not nihilists. On the other hand, I also think that the traditional Buddhist, especially today, if you take the Tibetan Buddhist approach to Advaita, that's also misplaced, I also feel. Because they think Advaita is talking about a thing, a substance. There is something called Brahman they are talking about, an eternal thing. Exactly what Gaudapada says, it's not that. So, it comes from a simplistic reading of the opponent. So, both sides have dismissed each other. The Buddhists dismiss Advaitins as they are talking about some belief in some kind of a God-like thing called Brahman. No, that's not real and they have logic to cut that down. And Advaitins, we have in the centuries from Shankara onwards, we have dismissed Nagarjuna's Shunyavada, Madhyamaka Buddhism as nothingness. They are just saying nothing exists. But that's"
