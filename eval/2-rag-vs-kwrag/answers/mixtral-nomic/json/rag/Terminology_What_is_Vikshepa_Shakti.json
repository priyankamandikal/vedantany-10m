    "a": " Vikshepa Shakti is a concept from Vedanta philosophy, explained in Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture titled \"Introduction to Vedanta Part 5.\" Shakti means power, and Maya, another name for this power, has two aspects: veiling power (Avarana Shakti) and projecting power (Vikshepa Shakti).\n\nVikshepa Shakti is the power that projects or presents consciousness-bliss as the world, the body, and the mind. In other words, it is the power that makes us perceive the inner Self, which is pure consciousness, bliss, and existence, as if it were something external or different from us. This power causes the misperception of the true nature of our Self.\n\nAn illustrative example of Vikshepa Shakti is the classic Advaita example of mistaking a rope for a snake in semi-darkness. In this scenario, the rope represents the true Self (consciousness-bliss), while the snake represents the world, body, and mind. The ignorance of the true nature of the rope (Avarana Shakti) leads to the misperception of the snake (Vikshepa Shakti). So, Vikshepa Shakti not only hides the true nature of the Self but also projects a false appearance, causing us to identify with the body-mind complex and the external world instead of recognizing our true nature as pure consciousness.",

So Maya presents this existence consciousness bliss as the mind, as the body and as this universe spread out in front of this body-mind complex. This is called the vikshepa shakti. Shakti means power. Another name of Maya is Shakti. Shakti means power. Why is it called Shakti? Because it has two powers. What are the two powers? The veiling power, avarana shakti. The projecting power, the vikshepa shakti. Avarana shakti and vikshepa shakti. If it sounds too metaphysical, too speculative to you, it is not. It's something that we experience all the time. If I mistake a rope for a snake in the semi-darkness, to take the classic Advaita example, if I mistake a rope for a snake in the darkness, I see a snake. But it's not a snake. Later on I realize it's a rope. Now what happened then? Two things happened. I was ignorant of the fact that it is a rope. This ignorance is the veiling power. It hides as it were the rope from me. That's number one. And the next what happens? I make a mistake. I see it as a snake. There's no snake. What happened? This very ignorance, it projected, it hid the rope for me as it were. And it projected the rope as a snake. That's what happens. That my ignorance of the rope not only hid the rope from me, it did a second thing. The real mischief comes next. It projects a snake. It presents the rope itself as a snake. I don't know the rope and"
