    "a": " Adhyaropa Apavada is a method used in Advaita Vedanta philosophy to convey the true nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality. This method consists of two steps: Adhyaropa and Apavada.\n\nAdhyaropa, which means superimposition, is the process of mistakenly attributing the qualities of one thing to another. In the context of Advaita Vedanta, it refers to superimposing the qualities of the material world onto Brahman, the absolute reality. For example, considering the universe to be separate from or different than Brahman is an instance of Adhyaropa.\n\nApavada, on the other hand, is the process of negating or removing the superimposed qualities to reveal the true nature of the object. In the context of Advaita Vedanta, it refers to the recognition that the universe is not separate from or different than Brahman, but is in fact nothing other than Brahman itself. This realization is achieved by negating the false superimpositions that were previously made.\n\nThe process of Adhyaropa Apavada is crucial in Advaita Vedanta as it helps in understanding the true nature of reality. The author of the Vedanta Sara text first defines the terms 'real' and 'unreal' to establish a clear understanding of these concepts before delving into the process of Adhyaropa Apavada. This method is significant as it helps in realizing the oneness of the individual self (Atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman).",

            "content": "So in Vedanta Sara we were on text number 39. We have done up to 39. It's important to take a quick look back and see what we have accomplished so far. Vedanta says that it will be taught by the method of Adhyaropa Apavada, which means superimposition and desuperimposition. So what is Adhyaropa and what is Apavada, what is superimposition? It is taking the reality to be not what it is, taking the rope to be the snake for example. So you take the absolute, Brahaman, to be this world. We are the absolute, but we take ourselves to be this body, mind, these persons. So that's superimposition and that's an error and that has to be corrected. What is the correction? The negation that is called Apavada, desuperimposition. What is that like? It's like recognizing that it's not a snake, it's a rope. Recognizing that it's not the universe, it is nothing other than Brahaman, the absolute. I am that absolute. So that is the negation, that is desuperimposition. That's going to be the whole process and that's the heart of all that goes on in Advaita Vedanta. For that, the author first has to define what he means by real and unreal. Note that the process is always, he introduces new terms and then immediately defines them. That's the importance of this text. Why are we at all doing this particular text? We have already done Dvig Drishya Viveka or Aparoksha Anubhuti, which are wonderful teachings of, you know, that they present Advaita Vedanta in a, I would say, much more interesting way"
