    "a": " Based on Swami Sarvapriyananda's teachings in the provided passage, the process of identifying with the body-mind is indeed a natural process that happens without much conscious effort. It is a result of our ignorance of our true nature as unlimited consciousness or Brahman. This identification is compared to mistaking a rope for a snake, where the true identity is obscured by our false beliefs and perceptions.\n\nHowever, the process of dis-identifying from the body-mind and realizing our true nature as awareness does not necessarily require a lot of effort, but rather a shift in understanding and awareness. According to Swami Sarvapriyananda, our individual identities are described as \"flimsy\" and constantly changing due to various factors such as age, diseases, and mental disorders. On the other hand, awareness is described as constant, unchanging, and our true identity.\n\nTherefore, the key to dis-identifying from the body-mind is to turn our attention inward and become more aware of our true nature as awareness. This can be achieved through practices such as meditation, self-inquiry, and contemplation. It is not so much about making a great effort, but rather about removing the veils of ignorance that cover our true nature.\n\nAs for the comparison between Advaita and Nisargadatta's teachings, Swami Sarvapriyananda states that the core principle is the same, emphasizing the unity of unlimited awareness or Brahman. So, the process of dis-identification from the body-mind and realizing our true nature as awareness would be similar in both traditions.",

Not only think, I firmly believe and act as if I am body-mind. Yes, these identities are ephemeral. Notice our individual identity can disappear. If there is a little stroke in the brain, then the mind also fails to function properly. Mind requires the brain as hardware. If your hardware in a computer is not working well, your software also will not run well. It will keep crashing, there will be problems. Similarly our identities get shaken or dissolved or distorted if there is a physical problem in the brain, if there are mental disorders. Our individual identities are very flimsy. Age can affect, senility can affect, various diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's can affect, stroke can affect, mental illnesses can affect our identities. Our identities are very flimsy. Throughout it all, one thing is constant, awareness is constant. If I am confused about my identity, if I am suffering from amnesia, identity loss or something, I am still aware. That awareness does not come and go. So, awareness is our real identity. It is not based on choice, it is not based on accident, not based on body-mind. It is our real identity. Now, the first question is interesting. How does the Advaita which we are speaking about differ from Nisargadatta's Advaita? It doesn't. First of all, the core principle is the same. There is one unlimited awareness, Brahman, in which the"
