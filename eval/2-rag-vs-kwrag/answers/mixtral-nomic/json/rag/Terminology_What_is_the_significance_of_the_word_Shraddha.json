    "a": " The word 'Shraddha' has a significant meaning in the context of the Mandukya Upanishad and Hindu traditions. It is a Sanskrit word that primarily refers to the funeral rites performed for departed ancestors. This term carries both psychological and spiritual connotations.\n\nPsychologically, Shraddha signifies the process of letting go for the people who are left behind. It helps the living come to terms with the loss and separation from their loved ones.\n\nOn the spiritual side, Shraddha is performed to ensure that the deceased embarks on a higher path (gati) in their journey after leaving the body. The belief is that the prayers, worship, and rituals conducted on behalf of the departed can add to their store of good karma. This extra positive karma acts as a booster rocket, helping the deceased reach a better world or higher level in their spiritual evolution.\n\nIn summary, 'Shraddha' is a crucial concept in Hindu traditions, symbolizing both a psychological release and a spiritual boost for the departed ancestors, enhancing their journey and ensuring a higher path for them in the afterlife.",

Whatever form of religion or spirituality, genuine religion or spirituality you find in your society, in your locality, it will pull you powerfully. It could be any form of spirituality. Basically they are all paths leading to the same reality. And it says that person will start practicing from wherever he or she left off helplessly. You cannot not walk on this path. You will walk on this path. And it says like this, this person goes on until he attains liberation. I'll come to you. What is the symbolism behind Shraddha? Shraddha is a Sanskrit word meaning the funeral rites which you perform for departed ancestors. One of course is psychological reason for letting go, for the people left behind. But the other is this one, for those who are transmigrating, having left the body, my father, mother, grandparents and so on and so forth. Let them have a higher gati, a higher path. They will go according to their karma. But your prayers and your worship and the rituals that you perform on their behalf adds to their store of good karma. It's a booster rocket you strap on so that they can go a little higher, maybe to a better world. So you pray for that. So that's what traditional Hindus believe in. But every culture you will see has prayers for the dead. They even talk in terms of helping to make the transition and so on and so forth. Once explained to me that time in the other"
