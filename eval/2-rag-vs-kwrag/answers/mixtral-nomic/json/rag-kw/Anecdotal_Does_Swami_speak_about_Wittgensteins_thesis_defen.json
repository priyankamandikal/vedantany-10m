    "a": " Yes, Swami Sarvapriyananda does speak about Wittgenstein's thesis defense in the lecture. Wittgenstein's thesis defense is significant because of the unique circumstances surrounding it. Wittgenstein, an unknown young man without formal education in philosophy, presented his work, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, as a PhD thesis at Cambridge. His examiners were Bertrand Russell and G.E. Moore, who were considered the two greatest living philosophers in the English philosophy scene at that time.\n\nDuring the defense, Wittgenstein's unconventional approach and ideas led to a debate and quarrel with the examiners. At one point, Wittgenstein stood up, patted both of them on their backs, and declared, \"Give it up, boys, you will never understand it,\" before walking out of the room. Despite this unusual exchange, Wittgenstein was still awarded his PhD.\n\nSwami Sarvapriyananda shares this story to emphasize two main points from Wittgenstein's work. First, Wittgenstein's statement in the Tractatus, \"The limits of language are the limits of my world\" and \"What cannot be expressed in language must be passed over in silence,\" highlights the idea that there are aspects of existence that cannot be captured or described by language. Second, Wittgenstein's approach to teaching philosophy without relying on textbooks illustrates the importance of original thinking and exploration in the pursuit of philosophical understanding.",

Moore Who was Russell's senior colleague They were the two greatest living philosophers in the English philosophy scene at that time They are the examiners Wittgenstein is an unknown young man Who has not studied philosophy as a subject, ever He's sitting there They are gossiping for some time And Moore says to Bertrand Russell Bertie, don't you think we should ask some questions? All right, opened the book at some random page Asked a question Wittgenstein tried to explain They could not, they could not agree And there was a big debate, a quarrel And suddenly Wittgenstein stood up Patted both of them on their backs And said, give it up boys, you will never understand it And he walked out And they gave him the PhD Now, I'm giving the story to make two points One is, at the beginning of that book Not beginning, I think Statement number 5.5 or 5.6 Wittgenstein says The limits of language are the limits of the world And at the<br><br> end of the book he says What cannot be expressed in language Must be passed over in silence That's right He leaves it in silence Is that the introduction here? No, this is the book itself Last line of the book is The introduction to Of, of, to Wittgenstein Not Tractatus This is Tractatus Tractatus, yes Tractatus 5.5 or 5.6, that's one The limits of language The limits of my world Or limits of language, limits of my word That means, whatever you can describe with language Is in the word Whatever is a fact in the word Can be described in language Now, a positive wist would say Alright, but then what cannot be described in language Does not exist Wittgenstein says, there is something Which does exist Which cannot be expressed in language And we must pass over it in silence Isn't that transcendental basically? Probably, he doesn't say that Not only that, he says Another very interesting statement he makes When all the great problems, questions of science Will have been answered Nothing of worth will have been said No important problem of human life will have been solved He says When all the great questions of science have been answered None of the problems of human life will have been<br><br> solved Yes, but the question before that Translated to you maybe for that The limits of language The sentence before that, just that About silence Must be passed over in silence What cannot be expressed in language Must be passed over in silence So that's one statement I wanted to make The other statement is related to what you were using Consciousness and awareness, these words The semantic problem That's why this whole story came Now Wittgenstein would teach Not from a textbook He would stand and do philosophy He would think and speak So all his students, the description is like They would, with holding their breath Because what is coming out now is new Nowhere there is any textbook of philosophy",
