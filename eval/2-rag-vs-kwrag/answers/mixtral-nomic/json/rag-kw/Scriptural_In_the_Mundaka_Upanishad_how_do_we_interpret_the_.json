    "q": "In the Mundaka Upanishad, how do we interpret the parable of the two birds?",
    "c": "Scriptural",
    "k": "birds, mundaka upanishad",
    "a": " The parable of the two birds in the Mundaka Upanishad is a powerful metaphor that encapsulates our life experience and the possibility of spiritual freedom. \n\nIn this metaphor, there are two birds sitting on a tree. The tree represents the worldly existence or the tree of life, while the two birds symbolize the individual self and the higher Self. \n\nThe lower bird represents the individual self, also known as the jiva or the ego, which is engaged in the world. It hops from branch to branch, looking for satisfaction in the fruits of experiences, actions, and their consequences. Sometimes, this lower bird finds a fruit that is sweet, providing pleasure or happiness. At other times, it encounters a fruit that is bitter or unsatisfying, leading to disappointment or pain. This represents the ups and downs of life, where we constantly seek fulfillment through various desires and experiences.\n\nOn the same tree, there is a higher bird, representing the Supreme Self or Atman. This bird is the silent witness, observing the activities of the lower bird without being affected by them. The higher bird is always content and does not partake in the fruits consumed by the lower bird. It symbolizes the true nature of our Self, which is pure consciousness, untouched by the dualities of pleasure and pain, success and failure, or any worldly experiences.\n\nThe parable of the two birds suggests that our true nature is the higher bird, the silent observer. The way to spiritual freedom, as indicated by Swami Sarvapriyananda, is to realize this true nature by shifting our identification from the lower bird to the higher bird. This shift in identification allows us to experience the peace, joy, and freedom that are inherent in our true Self.\n\nIn summary, the parable of the two birds in the Mundaka Upanishad is an invitation to realize our true nature as the higher bird, the silent witness, and to find spiritual freedom by disidentifying from the lower bird's endless pursuit of worldly pleasures and pains.",

The subject is the two birds and how this thing, this whole concept of a tree and two birds sitting on it, it encapsulates our life as we experience it now, the possibility of spiritual freedom and how we can get that spiritual freedom and what we get out of it. All of that beautifully the two birds. So let's go straight into the subject. The reference is to the Mundaka Upanishads. The Upanishads we know are the core texts of Vedanta and in the Mundaka Upanishads, one of the most ancient of the Upanishads, in the third chapter 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 we find this thing described using the metaphor of the two birds and the tree. The original verses, the mantras go like this. I'll chant them out for you in the old Vedic Sanskrit and then I'll translate and then we'll go into it. So it goes something like this. Very poetic. What does it mean? There's a tree and on this tree there are two birds, the lower bird and the higher bird and what the lower bird does is it hops from branch to branch and looks at different fruits and picks one and finds it sweet, eats it up, looks for another one, picks it, gets a little bitter, gets a little taken aback, tries to eat",
