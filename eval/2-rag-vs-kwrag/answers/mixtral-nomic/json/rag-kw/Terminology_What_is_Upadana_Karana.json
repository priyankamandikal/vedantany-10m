    "a": " Upadana Karana, in the context of Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture on the Bhagavad Gita, refers to the material cause in the creation of the universe. It is the material out of which the universe is projected and created. According to Vedanta, as explained by Swami Sarvapriyananda, there is no distinction between the material and instrumental cause in the creation of the universe. The same reality, which is Consciousness plus Maya (Saguna Brahman), appears as the material cause (Upadana Karana) and is also the cause of intelligence and design in the creation of the universe (Nimitta Karana).\n\nTo illustrate this concept, Swami Sarvapriyananda provides examples of wood and furniture, as well as clay and pots. In these examples, the wood and the clay are the material causes (Upadana Karana) of the furniture and pots, respectively. The carpenter who transforms the wood into furniture and the potter who molds the clay into pots are the instrumental causes (Nimitta Karana). However, in the creation of the universe, there is no separate creator or material, as stated in Vedanta Sara. Instead, Consciousness plus Maya (Saguna Brahman) serves as the single, non-dual cause (Abhinna nimitta upadana karana) for the material and intelligent design of the universe.",

So 83, but actually we are one consciousness, fragmented as if fragmented because of our individual ignorance, ajnana. That individual ignorance forms each of our causal body, karana sharira. And Ishwara provides us through the power of his maya he has created, provides us each with a subtle body and from time to time with a physical body, gross body, sukshma sharira, sthula sharira. And here we are. Here is a universe created by Ishwara. Here is a body and here is a mind and I am here as this limited consciousness, consciousness limited by individual ignorance. So this world view and these jivas, what's going on? What's the purpose of all of these? These limited jivas are now looking to find their way back to that unlimited consciousness, which is they themselves, which is their own real nature, which has not undergone any change. Now they are going to go back and Ishwara, who is the same unlimited consciousness, is helping these jivas to come home by creating this entire universe and this whole game of life and death, many lifetimes it goes on. So this is the sort of in brief, the cosmology. All of this, Sri Krishna now puts it in a slightly new way or old way. What I have said is Vedanta Sara is a sort of finished product and looking at all of this, a systematized presentation has been given to us in Vedanta Sara. Thousands of years before this, same idea Sri Krishna is saying. He says, I have two natures. What are the two natures? One is material nature, one is conscious nature. What is the material nature? Maya and all its products. What is the conscious nature? I, the consciousness, who am reflected in little bits of Maya, I am called this sentient being, the jivas and it is for these sentient beings that the universe is created, is sustained, finally dissolved, again created, until they all get enlightenment. So, Ishwara, that is consciousness plus Maya, is the cause of the universe and what cause? Vedanta Sara, if you remember, Abhinna nimittopadana karana, the one integral material and the instrumental cause. What is this material instrumental cause? Suppose there is wood, suppose there is wood which has become your furniture.<br><br> It does not become by itself. There is a carpenter who comes and transforms the wood into furniture. So, the carpenter is called the nimitta karana, the intelligent cause or the instrumental cause, the one who transforms the wood into furniture and the wood is the material of the furniture, the upadana karana. Upadana means material. Similarly, potter and clay and pots. Clay is the upadana karana material, potter is the instrumental cause, nimitta karana and pot is the product. What about the universe? What is the material cause? What is the instrumental cause? Upadana karana and nimitta karana. There is no distinction here. It is not a crude idea like there is a separate creator, there is some material like clay and then like potter made pot out of the clay, God makes the universe out of some material, not like that. There is only one reality and that itself appears as this universe. So, that is why Vedanta says God alone, Ishwar alone, Saguna Brahman alone is the Abhinna nimitta upadana karana. Consciousness plus Maya is the material out of which the entire universe is projected and is also the cause of it, the intelligent cause, the intelligence which designs, projects this entire universe. Here is, by the way, till now, the big difference between a religious point of view and a scientific, materialistic scientific point of view. See, we sort of feel that the clay cannot become a pot by itself, the wood cannot assemble itself into furniture. If you don't believe me, then you go to Ikea, you see what will happen to you. If you wait for it to be assemble itself, then you are in trouble.",
