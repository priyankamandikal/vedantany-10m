    "a": " Yes, in the lecture \"Raja Yoga: The Path of Meditation (Part 1),\" Swami Sarvapriyananda does share an incident related to the Hindu festival of Shivaratri. He talks about his own experience of fasting on Shivaratri for the first time when he became a monk. He explains that on this day, devotees of Lord Shiva observe a strict fast, which means no food or water from sunrise to sunrise the next day. \n\nSwami Sarvapriyananda also narrates an incident where a mathematics teacher approached a Swami and asked if he could fast on Shivaratri. The Swami responded sarcastically, pointing out that even young children are able to fast on this day, implying that the teacher should not find it difficult. This story highlights the significance of Shivaratri and the spiritual strength and dedication it is associated with.",
