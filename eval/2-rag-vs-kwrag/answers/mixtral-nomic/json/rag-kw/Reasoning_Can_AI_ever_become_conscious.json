    "a": " Based on Swami Sarvapriyananda's talk, the answer to your question is no, AI cannot become conscious. According to Swami Sarvapriyananda, scientists are not trying to create consciousness through AI, but are instead focusing on replicating and imitating human capacities such as intelligence, memory, decision-making, and creativity. He emphasizes that none of the experts in AI programming and computer science are claiming that AI is conscious, and they have no idea how to begin to make a system feel or be conscious.\n\nSwami Sarvapriyananda uses the example of self-driving cars to illustrate the difference between human consciousness and AI capabilities. While AI can perform the same activities as a human driver, such as seeing, hearing, and making decisions, it does not have the first-person experience or the feeling of being alive that humans have. This subjective experience, or consciousness, is not present in AI, and Swami Sarvapriyananda suggests that scientists have no idea how to create it.\n\nIn summary, based on Swami Sarvapriyananda's perspective, AI cannot become conscious, as consciousness is not simply a matter of performing certain activities but involves a subjective, first-person experience that scientists have yet to understand or replicate.",

            "content": "Alright, I will do this a little bit rapid fire style. We have gone well over time as usual. Do the AI question. Atanu Majumdar asks, scientists are busy creating consciousness through AI. If we can create machines which are self-conscious, how can we explain Atman then? You said that in deep sleep, some consciousness is still aware of the state of deep sleep. Scientifically, it has been observed that our brains are most active when we are in deep sleep. So isn't this awareness part of that? Is there any need to have Atman for explaining this? This is what is called materialist reductionism. Scientists are busy creating consciousness through AI. No, they are not. You just have to speak to a scientist. Any scientist, anybody who is working in AI especially. So what is AI doing? Look at the name, artificial intelligence, not artificial consciousness. So these new robots, AI, all of these programs, they are all imitating, replicating certain human capacities. Intelligence, memory, decision making, even creativity. The new AI machines are doing that. I was just mentioning it. I asked chat GPT to write me a poem on Swami Vivekananda. It did that. A very nice poem. And then I said, write me another poem on Swami Vivekananda. It did that also. It took less than 3 or 4 seconds.<br><br> And if I did that to chat GPT all day long, it would keep on writing poems by the dozens and hundreds all day long, all different poems and all pretty good. If you ask me to write a poem on Vivekananda, I could. But it would be maybe difficult for me to write one and I would take time over it. And if you ask me to keep writing poems every minute, I couldn't. None of us could. So AI can do those things. It can do just about everything they are capable of doing except one thing, which is consciousness. If you say, are you stipulating this? Are you saying that these things are not conscious? I always say that let's not get into this debate at all. It's not worthwhile. Ask the experts. Ask the people who are doing this programming. All of them will say, yes, we are making a claim that AI is intelligent, AI has memory, creativity, decision-making power. None of us are claiming that AI is conscious. By conscious, I mean, you have to understand what is meant by consciousness. Consciousness simply means the feeling of life itself, the capability of experiencing. I give the example of in San Francisco, you have these, what do you call them, self-driving cars, Google self-driving cars. It's very strange seeing one of them pull up next to you. No passenger, no driver, nothing. And driving merrily along, better than you. Now, but tell me one thing which is not there, you see, when you are driving the car, you have the sense of sound and sight and continuous feeling of taking decisions, sometimes anxiety, especially in San Francisco you will have very steep ups and downs. So the same activities are being performed by the AI in that car, but that AI has no feeling inside. It's not actually seeing. It has the behavior of seeing, but inside there is no feeling of seeing or hearing anything, or feeling anxious, or taking any decisions.<br><br> That feeling is not there. That first person experience is not there. And not only it's not there, if you ask these experts, the programmers and the computer scientists, consciousness studies experts, they have no idea at all how to begin. How to make a system intelligent? They have very good ideas and they are beginning to succeed. How to make it creative? They know how to do that and they are beginning to succeed. How to make it conscious? How to make it feel? No idea. It's not that it's difficult and we can't do it yet. They have no idea at all. Where to begin? How are we ourselves feeling? That also nobody knows. So scientists are not engaged in making AI conscious. They have no idea how to do that. But they are interested. And then the second question was that if these machines become conscious. Second part of it. You said that in deep sleep some consciousness is still aware of the state of deep sleep. Scientifically it has been observed that our brains are most active when we are in deep sleep. So isn't this awareness part of it? Yes, so you said that some consciousness even in deep sleep and now they are seeing that some parts of the brain, especially parts of the brain associated with consciousness, now they",
