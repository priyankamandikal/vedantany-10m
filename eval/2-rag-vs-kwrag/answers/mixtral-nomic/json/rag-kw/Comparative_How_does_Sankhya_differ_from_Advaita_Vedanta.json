    "k": "sankhya, advaita vedanta",
    "a": " Sankhya and Advaita Vedanta are two distinct schools of Indian philosophy, and while they share some similarities, they have significant differences in their teachings.\n\nSankhya philosophy focuses on the discernment of experience, known as drigdrishya viveka, to separate the seer (purusha) from the seen (prakriti). This separation of matter and consciousness is a central tenet of Sankhya, and it aims to help individuals realize their true nature as pure consciousness, separate from the entire universe.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta, on the other hand, does not teach this separation. Instead, it asserts the ultimate reality of non-dual Brahman, in which there is no distinction between the individual self (atman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman). Advaita Vedanta emphasizes the direct realization of this non-dual nature through self-inquiry and other spiritual practices.\n\nIn the passage you provided, Swami Sarvapriyananda explains that Advaita Vedanta does not accept the conclusions of Sankhya, even though it might seem similar. This is because Advaita Vedanta's focus on non-dualism differs from Sankhya's emphasis on the dualistic separation of purusha and prakriti.\n\nIn summary, Sankhya and Advaita Vedanta differ in their understanding of the relationship between the individual self and ultimate reality. Sankhya teaches a dualistic separation, while Advaita Vedanta emphasizes non-dualism.",

            "content": "The teachings of whether it's bhakti or meditation, yoga. I'll be a little philosophical here. In Indian philosophy, among the schools of Indian philosophy, these all other teachings, they constitute what is called purvapaksha for Advaita Vedanta. Let me be frank here. If you go to the original texts of Advaita Vedanta, Shankara and post Shankara Advaitins, they spend a lot of energy and a lot of subtle argumentation in cutting down these teachings. Let me be frank here. These are purvapaksha. We do not accept these siddhanta. Siddhanta means these conclusions. We accept the techniques. We have a place for each of them but not the conclusions. What do I mean by that? What are these schools which are cut down? The school of nyaya which ultimately culminates in the modern dualistic systems. What does nyaya say? Ultimately, devotion and surrender to God will take you beyond samsara. Bhakti will take you beyond samsara. Somebody who's trained in Indian philosophy may object to this. Where do you get this from nyaya philosophy? I'll say this nyaya philosophy is at the core of the modern or of the later dualistic theistic systems in Hinduism. If you look at Dvaita Vedanta, Vaishishtha Dvaita, Shuddha Dvaita, the schools of dualistic devotional schools and if you like open the machine up inside, if you find what are the philosophical parts which are working in that system, they're all nyaya. They've all adopted the nyaya system, nyaya Vaisheshika system. On that they've built a devotional theology. So that's why I am saying the ancient school of nyaya and Vaisheshika, their conclusion ultimately was God exists, take refuge in God, by devotion to God you will be saved. Theism built on nyaya. There were great practitioners of nyaya, the logicians.<br><br> They were not logicians in spiritual life. They were devotees in spiritual life. They're all bhaktas. That siddhanta is a purvapaksha for Advaita Vedanta, is an opponent for Advaita Vedanta and it is cut down. The yoga philosophy of Patanjali which says sit in meditation, sit in this way, breathe in this way, focus your mind in this way, meditate, deepen it into a complete cessation of the movements of the mind. There you will see the atman beyond the body and mind. Purvapaksha for Advaita Vedanta. This is not the teaching of Advaita Vedanta. It is cut down. Sankhya, even Sankhya philosophy. You might say Sankhya sounds very much like Advaita Vedanta. What does Sankhya say? By a discernment of our experience, drigdrishya viveka, which I have often spoken about, the seer and the seen, you finally isolate, you see yourself in your resplendent nature as pure consciousness. You don't see actually. Everything that is seen is an object. You are the seer of that object. You are pure consciousness. The entire universe appears to you and this insight of separating the witness consciousness from all that is illumined by consciousness, like a light shining on the room with everything in this the table, the chair, the man, the gadgets, the bed, everything is illumined by the same light but light is none of them. It illumines everything. Similarly, you are consciousness separate from the entire universe. This separation, the atma, anatma viveka, purusha prakriti viveka, the separation of purusha and prakriti, of matter and consciousness. How do you separate? In your understanding, in your insight, not physically. So this sounds like Vedanta. Isn't this what is being taught?<br><br> No, this is not what is being taught. Advaita does not teach this also. Then the teachings of Purvam Imamsa, which is entirely based on the Vedas, perform these ritualistic actions, generate good karma and you will be assured a good life here and a good life hereafter in future in heaven. You will go through the cycle of birth and death but you'll be assured of like a good birth. B-E-R-T-H. This is a joke where only Indians who have traveled in Indian railway system can understand. You always want a good birth in the railway coach. So, Advaita says no, no, not at all. Completely rejects this philosophy. So, for Advaita,",
