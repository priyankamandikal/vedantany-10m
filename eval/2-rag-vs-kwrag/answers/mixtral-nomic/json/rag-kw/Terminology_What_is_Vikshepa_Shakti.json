    "a": " Vikshepa Shakti is the projecting power of Maya, as described in Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture on Vedanta Part 5. In this context, Maya is the power that belongs to Brahman, the ultimate reality in Hindu philosophy. Maya has two primary powers: veiling (Avarana Shakti) and projecting (Vikshepa Shakti).\n\nThe veiling power hides the true nature of Brahman, which is existence, consciousness, and bliss, from our perception. This results in ignorance about our true self. The projecting power, Vikshepa Shakti, then manifests this hidden Brahman as the universe, body, and mind. It is the same consciousness that we discover through the process of Drik Drishya Viveka, but it is presented as the material world we experience.\n\nAn example of Vikshepa Shakti is mistaking a rope for a snake in semi-darkness. Ignorance (veiling power) hides the true nature of the rope, and then projects (projecting power) the rope as a snake. Similarly, our true nature as consciousness is hidden and projected as the universe we perceive.\n\nIn summary, Vikshepa Shakti is the power of Maya that projects and manifests the hidden Brahman as the material world we experience, including our bodies and minds.",

            "content": "Being the power, the power is not different from the one which wields the power. In Sanskrit it works very nicely. Shakti and Shaktiman, they are not different. Fire and its power to burn are not two different things. Fire illumines and it burns. So the power of the fire and the fire itself are not two different things. They are not, to use philosophical language, they are not ontologically separate. It is the same existence. It manifests as the power, the fire manifests as the power to illumine and to burn. It gives heat and light. In the same way, Brahman has a power called Maya which is at the root of this universe. What does it do? Maya has two powers. Maya itself has two powers. One is called the power of veiling. The Sanskrit word means veiling, covering, hiding. So Maya veils. What does it veil? It veils the reality, the witness that we are the witness. We are consciousness. It is hidden from us. We don't feel it. We don't know it. Even when we read about it in the Vedanta class, we forget it almost immediately. It is hidden from us. And not only that, not only is the witness Brahman hidden from us, Maya also projects.<br><br> It presents this very Brahman, this existence consciousness bliss, it presents it as the world. It presents it as the body. Maya presents this witness as the mind. So Maya presents this existence consciousness bliss as the mind, as the body and as this universe spread out in front of this body-mind complex. This is called the vikshepa shakti. Shakti means power. Another name of Maya is Shakti. Shakti means power. Why is it called Shakti? Because it has two powers. What are the two powers? The veiling power, avarana shakti. The projecting power, the vikshepa shakti. Avarana shakti and vikshepa shakti. If it sounds too metaphysical, too speculative to you, it is not. It's something that we experience all the time. If I mistake a rope for a snake in the semi-darkness, to take the classic Advaita example, if I mistake a rope for a snake in the darkness, I see a snake. But it's not a snake. Later on I realize it's a rope. Now what happened then? Two things happened. I was ignorant of the fact that it is a rope. This ignorance is the veiling power. It hides as it were the rope from me. That's number one.<br><br> And the next what happens? I make a mistake. I see it as a snake. There's no snake. What happened? This very ignorance, it projected, it hid the rope for me as it were. And it projected the rope as a snake. That's what happens. That my ignorance of the rope not only hid the rope from me, it did a second thing. The real mischief comes next. It projects a snake. It presents the rope itself as a snake. I don't know the rope and I see a snake. And this is exactly what Advaita is saying. In respect to this entire universe, body, mind and this universe, it is the same witness, the same consciousness which we discovered through the process of Drik Drishya Viveka in the first verse. What we discovered that that same consciousness, existence, bliss is projected as this universe, is first hidden and then projected as the universe, hiding avarana shakti of maya, projecting vikshepa shakti. Vikshepa shakti. Sri Ramakrishna describes the avarana shakti very nicely. He is sitting in his room in Dakshineshwar, in the Kali temple of Dakshineshwar. And he takes a little Indian towel called a ganchha. He takes this little towel and he puts it in front of his face. See, you are not able to see me. And he removes it. Now you are able to see me. In the same way, the grace of the divine mother, shakti is required to remove the veil which hides our true nature from us.<br><br> And that very true nature is projected as this universe. Now let's look at the verse. Shakti dvayam hi mayaya. Maya has two powers. What are these two powers? Vikshepa, avarati, rupakam. Rupakam of the form of vikshepa, projecting, avarati, veiling. Now first he takes up the vikshepa shakti. Then later he will take up the avarana shakti. And there is a method to this. Why? Maya is not entirely bad at all. The vikshepa shakti is actually, according to this brand of advaita, the vikshepa shakti which projects brahman as the universe is no problem at all.",
