    "a": " Adhyaropa Apavada is a method of teaching in Vedanta, used by a master to guide a student towards enlightenment and liberation from the suffering of samsara. This teaching method involves two steps: superimposition (Adhyaropa) and desuperimposition (Apavada).\n\n1. Superimposition (Adhyaropa): This is the initial step where the master introduces concepts or ideas that are not inherently true but are provisionally accepted for the sake of teaching. A classic example given is mistaking a rope for a snake. In this context, the universe and all its elements, including the 14 worlds, bodies, minds, and individual experiences, are superimposed on the ultimate reality, Brahman. This superimposition is a result of maya's projecting power, which leads to the manifestation of the entire universe.\n\n2. Desuperimposition (Apavada): After the student has understood the concept through superimposition, the next step is to withdraw or remove these provisional ideas, revealing the true nature of reality. In our example, this would be realizing that the snake is actually a rope. In the context of Vedanta, desuperimposition involves understanding that the universe and its elements are not separate from Brahman but are, in fact, Brahman itself. This realization leads to enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of suffering and rebirth.\n\nIn summary, Adhyaropa Apavada is a teaching method in Vedanta where the master uses superimposition to introduce concepts and then later desuperimposes those concepts to reveal the true nature of reality, ultimately guiding the student towards enlightenment and liberation.",

Adhyaropa is superimposition and apavada is desuperimposition. This is a portion which we started long back. If you recall, in text number 32, a long time back, if you refer back, you will see. To see the rope which is not a snake, to make a mistake and to see it as a snake, that is called adhyaropa, superimposition. To see what is not there or to think of something which is not that, Shankaracharya calls it atasmin tadbuddhi. What is not there, you see there, or what is not there, you think that is there. It is like a movie, for example. You see lots of stuff there, and yet there is only light and a screen. Similarly, in a dream, you see lots of people and places, but all that is there is the dreaming mind. The classic example of a rope, which you see, which one makes a mistake and thinks that it is a snake, but what is there is the rope only. That which is not a snake, to see that as a snake, to make a mistake about it, an error about it, that is called superimposition. The word for it is adhyaropa. All of that we did till now was to show how the entire universe which we experience is a superimposition on the reality which is Brahman. The reality which is a rope is seen as a snake by mistake. The reality which is Brahman is experienced as the universe by an error. There the error is caused by not knowing the rope, and we make a mistake about this snake. Here the error is caused by not knowing Brahman, the ultimate reality. And we all know why that happens. All of that we studied. Maya with its two functions, projecting power and availing power, and the projecting power leads to the manifestation of the entire universe. And so the manifestation of the entire universe up to the 14 worlds and the body and the mind and our samsara which we see, this is the limit of superimposition. This is what we have seen. The whole samsara is superimposed on Brahman just as a snake is superimposed on a rope.<br><br> This is just a fancy philosophical way of saying rope is mistaken for a snake. Brahman is mistaken for this universe. Now correction. We are going to begin a correction. Why at all are we doing this? Because this is the method of teaching. Remember, at the very beginning we were told that the master, the student goes to the master and says, how do I become enlightened? How do I become free from the sufferings of samsara? And the master teaches Vedanta. And we were told, how does the master teach Vedanta? The master teaches by the method of superimposition and desuperimposition. Adhyaropa Apavada. And that's what's going on. That's why the method of what is called superimposition was talked about till now.",
