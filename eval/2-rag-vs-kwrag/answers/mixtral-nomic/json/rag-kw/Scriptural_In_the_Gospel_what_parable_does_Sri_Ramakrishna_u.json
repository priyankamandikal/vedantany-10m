    "a": " In the Gospel, Sri Ramakrishna does not use a specific parable to portray intense longing for God. However, he often taught in parables and one of his most famous teachings is the story of the \"Greedy Brahmin's Wife and the Mango.\" This parable emphasizes the importance of intense longing or yearning in the path of spiritual growth and God-realization.\n\nThe story goes like this: A brahmin's wife was craving a mango but her husband couldn't find one for her. She became so desperate that she started to cry and pray for a mango. Her intense longing and devotion moved the god of death, Yama, who then appeared before her and offered her a mango from his garden. The moral of the story is that when one has such intense longing and yearning for God, just like the brahmin's wife for the mango, God reveals Himself to the devotee.\n\nIn this context, the story of the \"Greedy Brahmin's Wife and the Mango\" can be seen as a representation of intense longing for God in Sri Ramakrishna's teachings.",

            "content": "Om Sarva Dharma Sthapakastu Sarva Dharma Swaroopaka Acharyana Mahacharyo Ramakrishna Yudhenamaha We listened with interest to the different parables and we enjoyed the interpretations and explanations. I have noticed that whenever I work a parable into my talks, afterwards it's the parable which people seem to like. They recall the parable and long afterwards when I meet people, they recall the parable, not the rest of the philosophy which I spoke about. So parables definitely stay in our mind and they convey the essence of the teaching very effectively, more than theory or anything else. And the gospel is full of parables, wonderful parables. Sri Ramakrishna taught, often taught in these wonderful parables. The gospel, my first impression of it when I was a kid, was it's so big. You know when you listen to the parable page 850 or something like that, that's one big book. And I used to see the small Bengali letters and the small print and this thick book. So when my grandmother told me, when I was a kid, long long ago, my grandmother told me that she had read the gospel 10 times. I was awestruck and I ran to tell my dad, that you know grandma has read this book 10 times. And he said, only 10 times? She's so old, she must be lazy. She should have read it many more times by now. When we approach the gospel, we take away certain things from it. The first thing that we are confronted with is the existence of God. One thing that leaps out of the pages of the gospel to us is that God exists. In fact I read about this contemporary sage, contemporary saint in southern India, whose diary he writes how he came to God, how he came to believe in God. And one of the points he writes there is just one word, Ramakrishna. Just the life of Ramakrishna is the most powerful argument for the existence of God. And that's so relevant to our times. When we have in the 21st century this wave of new atheism, the grounds for belief in religion and God seem to be diminishing. The rug seems to be pulled out from under our feet. So in this context, when we read the gospel of Ramakrishna, our faith is strengthened and we get this infusion of belief, of conviction that God does exist. Here is this person who is full of God. Throughout the day it's God, God.<br><br> He says in one place, Believe me, I say upon the mother, I know nothing but God. So that's the first thing that we take away from the gospel of Ramakrishna. Faith in the existence of God. And the second thing that we come across in the gospel while reading it is God can be experienced. You can actually see God, you can have God-realization, you can have God-vision, whether with eyes closed or with eyes open, in some form or the other. Here is this person, Ramakrishna, who not only has seen God, but sees God just about every day, and more than once in a day. Narendranath, later to become Swami Vivekananda, came and asked that question for all of us. Have you seen God? Not whether God exists. He asked an even more direct question, challenge. Have you seen God? And he found the first person who could give a direct answer to his question, to a very direct question, Sri Ramakrishna said, yes, I have seen God. Just as I see you, even more clearly. So that is a great takeaway for modern man. That God can be experienced. Swami Vivekananda was to say later in this country, if somebody says, I have seen God, but you cannot, you only have to believe what I say, do not trust him. If somebody says, I have seen God, and you can too, then you can trust him. And this book says to us, again and again and again, that God can be experienced. God can be experienced by everybody. Whoever wants, can experience God. And the third thing which comes out of this book is, not only God exists, not only can the Lord be experienced, God can be realized, but also, the purpose of life is precisely this God realization. In this world, even in the most affluent countries, of the West, in America, or in Western Europe, in Australia, New Zealand, the most advanced and affluent countries, where we have done the best, the societies have done the best they can to provide a most comfortable, a very good life. Everybody is haunted by a sense of purposelessness, meaninglessness. What is the purpose of life? Why are we here? For such a short duration, very soon we will be gone from here.",
