    "k": "vedanta, christopher isherwood",
    "a": " Christopher Isherwood was a British-born novelist and playwright who became a prominent figure in the Vedanta Society of Southern California, particularly through his close association with Swami Prabhavananda. His contribution to Vedanta can be seen in his role as a dedicated disciple and a literary figure who produced significant works promoting Vedanta philosophy.\n\nIsherwood is best known for his well-written biography of Sri Ramakrishna, titled \"Ramakrishna and His Disciples.\" This book is often recommended for those seeking an understanding of Sri Ramakrishna in the English language, both in the United States and India. Despite facing some criticism and accusations of joining a \"Hindu cult,\" Isherwood maintained his connection with the Vedanta Society until the end of his life.\n\nHis work as a writer helped spread the teachings of Vedanta, contributing to the understanding and popularity of the philosophy in the West. Additionally, his involvement with the Vedanta Society brought together a group of intellectuals and artists, allowing for a rich exchange of ideas and fostering a better appreciation of Vedanta teachings in Western culture.",
