    "a": " In the Mandukya Upanishad, the word 'Om' holds great significance as it represents the entirety of what we experience as the universe, encompassing the gross, subtle, and causal levels of existence. The three letters of 'Om' - A, U, and Ma - correspond to the waking state (gross level), the dreaming state (subtle level), and the deep sleep state (causal level) respectively. The sound 'A' represents the physical world and the waker, while 'U' signifies the subtle level of mind, intellect, and memory. Lastly, 'Ma' symbolizes the causal level where everything is withdrawn, as experienced in deep sleep.\n\nHowever, the true self, referred to as Turiya, is beyond these three levels. It is the silent consciousness that exists beyond the manifestation of 'Om'. The Upanishad teaches that we should understand ourselves as this pure consciousness, which appears as the waker, dreamer, and deep sleeper, as well as their respective worlds. The true essence of 'Om' lies in the silence that follows after its pronunciation, representing the transcendental reality of Turiya.\n\nIn summary, 'Om' in the Mandukya Upanishad signifies the complete universe, including all its levels of existence, while also pointing towards the ultimate reality of Turiya - the silent, pure consciousness that is our true nature.",

            "content": "So the turiya, the real self, is not the gross level, sthula Atma, is not the subtle level, the sukshma Atma, is not the causal level also, the karana Atma. Beyond the sthula sukshma karana is the turiya, the real self. And notice, anamakam, arupakam, beyond name and form, all, see the entire waking universe and you the waker, together, are represented by, do you remember, om? A, the first letter of om. The entire subtle universe, your universe of dreams, the mental, the subtle level, whatever is going on in the mind now, mind, intellect, memory, that is represented by the letter, u. And the deep sleep, where everything is withdrawn, the causal level, is represented by the letter, ma. So if you put them together, a, u, ma, om, the whole, the om represents the gross, subtle and causal. The entirety of what we experience as the universe, the whole thing is om. Om, just the om represents the whole thing and we are saying, I am not that. I am what is beyond the om, the silence beyond the om. The silence beyond the om represents turiya. I'll come to you. So anamakam, om itself, all the sounds are encapsulated in om and with those sounds all words are made. So all language in a way is encapsulated in om. Om represents all language and om represents the entire universe, gross, subtle, causal. Don't look at me as if it's something new. We did it all a long time ago. It's understandable if I have forgotten. But that is the meaning of om. The real meaning of om is after om, the silence after om, which represents turiya, the pure consciousness. So anamakam, beyond names and all the forms, gross, subtle, causal, arupakam, beyond all these forms is the turiya, the pure consciousness. Yes. They say om itheka aksharam brahma. Not they say. Upanishad says. Who comes first, the Gayatri mantra or the Mandukya Upanishad? Gayatri mantra or the Mandukya Upanishad.<br><br> Who comes first in what sense? Both are Vedic. Both are Vedic. But Gayatri mantra says om bhuvah svaha om, tat savit varenyam bhargo de. So it says like om is everything. Now Mandukya says something is there left out after om. Mandukya does not say something is left out after om. This turiya is not left out after om. Om includes the silence after the om, which represents turiya. So it's consistent with Gayatri mantra. Absolutely. It's the same thing. Exactly the same thing. When Gayatri says bhuvah svaha, the three worlds and om speaks about the gross, the subtle and the causal. All three are within maya and all of it is om. And what is om? Beyond the maya, the silence which represents pure consciousness, brahman, that is also om. So brahman is all of this. In what way? A rope is mistaken as a snake. Now the rope is not a snake and yet the snake is none other than the rope. Can you follow this? Practically it is so. The rope in itself is not a snake. But that snake which you saw is nothing other than the rope itself.<br><br> Similarly, brahman is not the world. But this world which we experience is nothing other than brahman. So first of all turiya has to be understood, the fourth has to be understood as apart from waker, dreamer, deep sleeper, pure consciousness. Having understood that, then you realize it is this pure consciousness alone which appears as the waker and the waker's world. A, dreamer and the dream world, u and deep sleeper and the deep sleep merged darkness, m. So it is from that silence alone om emerges. So the whole thing is om. But at the beginning if you say everything is om, you will think oh so that brownstone is om and this man is om, that woman is om, all of this is brahman. Not in this way. If you say the snake is rope, you say oh that snake, that means the rope must be like a snake, rope is like a rattlesnake or something. No, no, the snake is not, the rope is. After understanding that, then only are you entitled to say the rope alone appears as the snake. World is not, brahman is.",
