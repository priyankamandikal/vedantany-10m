    "c": "Scriptural",
    "k": "gospel of sri ramakrishna, thakur, salt doll",
    "a": " In the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, the analogy of the salt doll is used to describe the nature of realizing Brahman, the ultimate reality. The salt doll, in its attempt to measure the ocean, ultimately merges with the ocean and loses its individual existence. This can be seen as a metaphor for the realization of Brahman, where the individual self (jeeva) merges with the ultimate reality (Brahman) and loses its separate identity.\n\nIn the context of the passage you provided, Swami Sarvapriyananda explains that when one plunges mentally into that reality (Brahman) through deep meditation (samadhi), the mind becomes still and aware of its true nature as Brahman. This is similar to the salt doll merging with the ocean and becoming one with it.\n\nWhen a person realizes Brahman, they can't express their experience in words, as there is no separate individual left to speak about it. However, their actions and teachings may provide approximations of that experience, serving as the basis for religious and spiritual practices.\n\nIn summary, the analogy of the salt doll in the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna illustrates the concept of realizing Brahman by merging the individual self with the ultimate reality, which is beyond words and individual identity.",

            "content": "crosses the black waters, that was a kind of saying. Similarly, Sri Ramakrishna would use these as metaphors. When you plunge mentally, the mind, into that reality. And what do I mean by plunge? Didn't you just say Swami that we are that reality? Yes, you are that reality. But the mind which is investigating this can now be stilled in meditation. It's called samadhi. And then the mind is stilled but not asleep. It's like being fully awake in deep sleep, if you can wrap your mind around that. Fall asleep, you are not aware of the external world, you are not aware of the physical body, you are not aware of the mind, you are not even aware of that I am sleeping. If you are aware of that, you are not sleeping. And in sleep, you are in deep sleep. But here you are awake, you are fully awake. The world is blanked out. The body, the senses and the mind is also blanked out. And yet you are endlessly aware. From an external perspective, you might seem to be not aware of anything. Sri Ramakrishna goes into samadhi many times. So many people saw this. Not only that, he would become as still. The description always was, he becomes like a picture. As still as a picture. A doctor examined him. Heartbeat stopped, breathing stopped. They touched the eyeball, no reflex.<br><br> It's like being dead. Not only being unaware, actually being dead or in deep coma. And yet when he was asked, Are you unconscious at that time? No. Sri Ramakrishna's response was, Does one meditating on consciousness become unconscious? So it's only consciousness, but no object to it. There is no limited object which is aware of a limited object. Now there are many of these states. They are studied in a system called yoga. It's not just one samadhi. Samadhis are of different grades and different types. Now the point being asked here is, So it is you are aware. And what is it like exactly? Well, two things. And that state obviously you can't speak. Because from your perspective there is no world, there is nobody to speak to, there is no body, there is no speech, there is not even a mind. Coming back from that state, arising from that state in the sense that the body-mind starts functioning again. You are clearly aware of, you means the mind now is clearly aware of what happened there. But there is no way of expressing it at all. Only approximations can be there. And those approximations are basically the basis of all religion. The way the masters in different religions have pointed it out. And mystics who have realized it have pointed towards it. And many practices which will help you to reach that. Another example, he uses the salt doll who went to measure the ocean. If a salt doll goes to measure the ocean, first of all measuring the ocean is impossible for the doll. Second, can it do so? The moment it enters the ocean, it becomes the ocean. It floats up into the ocean, becomes the ocean. There is no individual left who will come back and say that the ocean is like this. Even when in Jeevan Mukta, the person actually comes back in the sense, it seems to from our perspective that a person has come back.",
