    "a": " Based on Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture, the process of identifying oneself with the body-mind complex does not necessarily require much effort, as it is a natural and instinctive process that occurs due to ignorance. It is a deeply ingrained habit to equate our self with the body, and this identification happens automatically from birth. We grow up believing that we are the body, and our experiences and perceptions are shaped by this fundamental misconception.\n\nHowever, when it comes to dis-identifying oneself from the body-mind complex and realizing the true nature of pure consciousness, it does require effort, self-exploration, and understanding. This process involves recognizing the inherent differences between the body-mind complex and the self, and understanding that the body-mind is not separate from consciousness but is, in fact, made up of the same essential reality.\n\nThe initial distinction made between the self and the body-mind complex is a deliberate and necessary step in the spiritual journey. It serves to break the strong identification with the body and create an awareness of the existence of a separate entity \u2013 the self or pure consciousness. This separation is crucial for understanding the true nature of reality and realizing the oneness of all existence.\n\nThe passage highlights that the distinction between the self and the not-self (body-mind complex) can indirectly lead to the perception of the body-mind as an independent entity, which is not the case. The body-mind complex is not a separate reality but an expression of pure consciousness. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to understand and experience the unity of all existence, which transcends the dualistic perception of self and not-self.\n\nIn summary, the initial identification with the body-mind complex happens effortlessly due to ignorance, while dis-identifying oneself from it requires conscious effort, self-exploration, and understanding. The distinction between the self and the body-mind complex is a necessary step in the spiritual journey, but it is essential to recognize that the body-mind complex is not a separate reality but an expression of pure consciousness.",

            "content": "I am separate from the world, I'm separate from the body, I'm separate from the mind, I am the witness consciousness of the body-mind world. Now you are saying that there is only one reality, pure consciousness. If pure consciousness alone shines forth as this world, why did you make this distinction between consciousness and everything else? Especially why did you make this difference between consciousness and the body? What did they just say now? Just as a pot is all clay, through and through it's clay. When you examine it, it's made of clay. It's just clay. All of it is clay. Similarly, this body-mind complex is nothing but pure consciousness. That's the claim which is being made here. When we first started Vedanta, we were shown, we were told, look, just as this book is an object and I am the experiencer of the book, I am the seer of the book, the seer of the book and the book are different. Similarly, I, the experiencer of the body, I am different from the body. I must be a different entity and we had so many reasons. It was so strongly and well argued that the body is ever changing, I see myself as not changing, the body is an object, I am the subject, the body is not conscious, I am conscious and so many other reasons were given. I think seven or eight reasons were given to carefully distinguish the body from the other, the self from the body and the mind. We did that so carefully and now it's just being reversed. It's saying that's the division done by the ignorant to no purpose. What does it mean? We must understand this carefully. You see, at that stage, at the beginning, this division was done. Why was it done? It was not wrong, it was done with a purpose. This identification with this body that I am, who am I? I am this body and what else are you? Nothing else.<br><br> I am this body and what is this body? It's me. What are you? Body. What is this body? Me. It's I. So this strong identification with the body only and nothing else. This has to be broken because we are so convinced that we are this body. With the birth of the body, I am born. With the aging of the body, I am aging. With the sickness of the body, I am sick. With the pleasure of the body, I am happy. With the misery of the body, I am unhappy. When the body is feeling hot, I am hot. When the body is feeling cold, I am shivering in cold. When the body feels hunger, I am hungry. When the body is satiated, I am satiated. It seems so beyond dispute to me that this distinction has to be drawn sharply first. That I am not the body. This cutting of the identification with the body has to be done first. That's what was done at the beginning. Now what they're going to show now is, am I audible to everybody? At the back too? Yes. Now what they're going to show is, when you keep talking about distinguishing the Atma from the Anatma, the self from the not-self, the pure consciousness witness from the body-mind, you indirectly tend to set up the body-mind as an independent existence.<br><br> As if there are two things. Here is one book and here is another book. Two separate things. So here is a witness consciousness and here is a body-mind and the two are not the same. They're different from each other. You're setting up the body-mind as if it were real. Now they're going to show that the body-mind is not a reality. The body-mind is not a reality. That's going to be shown now. Other than the self, the not-self, what is the not-self? Mind is not-self. Body is not-self. The universe is not-self.",
