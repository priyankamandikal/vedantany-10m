    "a": " Based on the passage provided, Advaita Vedanta would not fully agree with the Kashmir Shaivism concept of Chit being both Prakasha and Vimarsha. \n\nIn Kashmir Shaivism, Chit, or consciousness, is seen as both self-luminous (Prakasha) and self-reflective (Vimarsha). This means that Shiva, the ultimate nature of reality, is not only infinite existence, infinite consciousness, and infinite bliss but also self-aware. It is aware of itself, its own existence, and the entire universe it has projected.\n\nHowever, in Advaita Vedanta, self-awareness is not attributed to the ultimate reality, Brahman, in the same way. According to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is pure consciousness and infinite existence, but self-awareness begins only when the mind starts functioning. The consciousness alone, with the help of Maya, projects the entire universe, including the body and mind. The awareness of one's self as a person or even as Brahman is considered a function of the mind, which is not ultimately real. \n\nSo, while Kashmir Shaivism sees self-awareness as an integral part of reality, Advaita Vedanta views it as a function of the mind and not a fundamental aspect of the ultimate reality.",
