    "a": " Based on Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture and the passage provided, the answer to your question is no, our senses do not report reality to us as it is. According to the cognitive scientist mentioned in the article, our senses have been evolved to make us fit for survival, not to understand reality. They are designed to magnify dangers and reduce insignificant things, reporting only what is necessary for our survival. This means that what we perceive through our senses is not an accurate representation of the world as it is, but rather a version of it that has been filtered through the lens of survival.\n\nFurthermore, Swami Sarvapriyananda explains that the aim of Vedanta's philosophical arguments is to show us that what we are experiencing is nothing other than Brahman, the ultimate reality. Our attention is usually focused on the world, our bodies, and our minds, which are all part of the illusion created by our senses. To realize the reality and experience Brahman, we need to take our eyes off the false and focus on the real, shifting our attention from the finite and dual to the infinite and non-dual.\n\nIn summary, our senses do not report reality to us as it is. They have been evolved to make us fit for survival, and what we perceive through our senses is a filtered version of the world. To realize the ultimate reality, we need to shift our attention from the world to the Self, the real, capitalized Self.",

            "content": "Nature means the entire world, including our bodies and minds. So, now in that process, how do they do this? They will show us philosophically, through subtle arguments, they will show us how what we are experiencing is nothing other than Brahman, the ultimate reality. Now one thing I would like to point out here, this is not just dry philosophy. No matter how interesting it is, they have a very deep spiritual aim in mind. It's not just dialectics, it's not just reasoning for the sake of reasoning, just an interesting philosophy, but it's something that's deeply, intimately connected with our spiritual lives. How so? How is all this connected with our spiritual lives? To realize the reality, to experience God or realize Brahman, to realize that we are Brahman, you see, the main problem is that our attention is entirely on the world. Our attention is on the world out there, our attention is on our bodies, our attention is on our minds, and that's all that we consider to be real. Our attention is on the ornament, not on the gold. Our attention is on the table, not on the wood. So, the first thing that has to be done is, the attention has to be removed from the, has to be stopped, take our eyes off the false and focus on the real. Take our eyes from the finite and focus on the infinite. Take our eyes from the duality, from the vision of duality to the vision of non-duality. From the not-self, anatma in Sanskrit, to the Self, the real, capitalized Self. Just yesterday, somebody forwarded to me a very interesting article published in the well-known magazine, The Atlantic. This is a magazine, The Atlantic. A cognitive scientist, right here, our next-door neighbor in UC Irvine, his name is Hoffman. Now, there's an interview with this scientist, and what he's saying is, what our senses reveal to us, the world, is absolutely illusory. It's an illusion. The reality is not revealed by our senses. Now, why should this be difficult to understand? Because, till now, the idea was that our senses have been generated by evolution. So, all animals, including our senses, our eyes, ears, and all our sense organs, are products of evolution. And they are there to give us an evolutionary advantage.<br><br> And the thinking was, till now, till very recently, the thinking was, if the senses did not report reality, then the animal wouldn't survive. If the senses reported something else, and the world was something else, then the animal wouldn't fit in the world and wouldn't survive long enough. And so, it wouldn't transmit its genes across generations. Therefore, if we have survived for thousands and thousands of years, if our senses are the product of thousands of years of evolution, then our senses do fit the environment, so they repeat, they report to us, the reality of the environment. That was the thinking. And he says, not at all. What the senses have been evolved to do is to make us fit for survival. And we go, yes, that's what we are saying. And being fit for survival is quite different from understanding reality. He gives an example in that interview itself. Now, out there, you see a body of water. There may be very little water, there may be just some amount of water, and there may be a lot of water. Now, very little water means the animal would perish. A lot of water means the animal might drown. Just the right amount of water is what the animal needs to survive. Now, if the senses were neutral, it would report things exactly as they are. But the senses are designed for survival. So, if there is something dangerous, that will be magnified. If there is something insignificant, that will be reduced. It will report only that which is necessary for the animal to survive, not things as they are outside. So, what you will see actually is not quite what is there outside. He gives a more detailed explanation. So, our senses are not reporting what's out there. And then he goes deeper in that article itself. Two huge problems in quantum mechanics, which I don't claim to understand, and in neuroscience, which again I don't claim to understand much. But the two big problems right now they are saying is, neuroscientists are confronted with what is called the hard problem of consciousness. This is an intractable problem. They have absolutely no idea how to tackle it.",
