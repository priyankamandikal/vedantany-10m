    "a": " Yes, Swami Sarvapriyananda does refer to The Matrix movie in his lecture titled \"Vedantic Self-Enquiry.\" He uses the concept of a \"glitch in the Matrix\" as an analogy to explain the Vedantic perspective on the nature of the self and the world. According to Swami Sarvapriyananda, in The Matrix, the glitch represents the true nature of reality being revealed, which is similar to how Vedanta reveals the true nature of the self. \n\nIn this analogy, the self is pure consciousness, but due to Maya (the illusion), we identify ourselves with the objects of awareness, such as the body and mind. This identification leads us to believe that we are separate, limited individuals. However, the truth is that we are the unchanging, infinite consciousness that is aware of these objects.\n\nSwami Sarvapriyananda suggests that the way out of this illusion is through spirituality, specifically Vedanta, but also all other paths. This is because spiritual practices help us to realize our true nature as pure consciousness, freeing us from the limitations of identifying with the objects of awareness.",

We are not coming and going. The reader is not coming and going. We are reading the book of nature. That's one answer. See what appeals to you. I am giving you different options. The second one is, the second question is, the second approach I take is, have you seen the Matrix movie? So, it's a thing I came up with when I saw the Matrix movie. There is a glitch in the Matrix. The glitch is this. You are pure consciousness. But somehow, we don't know how, you don't know it. Not knowing it, not knowing your nature as awareness, what is presented to awareness, the object, you have identified with it. I don't know that I am this person. When I see myself in the mirror, I think, I am that person. That mirror is my body and that face is my mind. That thing is me. I have nothing to do with it. It's a reflection in the mirror. So, the mirror is provided by Maya. And we are reflected ourselves in that mirror and now we are living as these little creatures. And the way out is spirituality. Vedanta, of course, but all paths. One answer. I can see you are not particularly convinced by it. Deep philosophical answer. Before I go to the deep answer, a little easier one. These are the ones I like. The answer is this.",
