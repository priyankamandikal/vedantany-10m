    "k": "vedantasara, phala vyapti, vritti vyapti",
    "a": " In Vedantasara, Phala Vyapti and Vritti Vyapti are two important concepts related to the process of acquiring knowledge.\n\nVritti Vyapti refers to the process of destroying ignorance about an object. It is the mental activity or the focusing of the mind that is required to understand or cognize an object. In the context of Brahma Jnana or self-knowledge, Vritti Vyapti is necessary to destroy the ignorance about the self. However, once this ignorance is destroyed, the reflected consciousness which is necessary for illuminating other objects is not required anymore. This is because the self, or Brahman, is the source of all consciousness and does not need to be illumined by an external source.\n\nPhala Vyapti, on the other hand, refers to the illumination or revelation of the object once the ignorance about it has been destroyed. In other words, it is the knowledge or understanding that arises after the Vritti Vyapti has taken place. However, in the context of Brahma Jnana, Phala Vyapti is not necessary because the self is not an object that can be known or understood in the same way as other objects. Instead, it is the very consciousness that is doing the knowing, and so there is no need for an additional illumination.\n\nTo summarize, Vritti Vyapti is the process of destroying ignorance about an object, while Phala Vyapti is the illumination or revelation of the object once the ignorance has been destroyed. In the context of self-knowledge, Vritti Vyapti is necessary to destroy the ignorance about the self, but Phala Vyapti is not necessary because the self is not an object that can be known in the same way as other objects.",

            "content": "And if the recipient understands it in exactly the same way as what the communicator wanted to convey, then the communication is successful. So the Upanishadic communication is successful. Then what will happen is there will be a vritti vyapti about Brahman. What it is like, it just sort of falls into place, it clicks in a moment. And that vritti vyapti, normally it should be illumined by the reflected consciousness. But the reflected consciousness is not necessary anymore. Why? Because the reflected consciousness is coming from Brahman. It's like, I give you the example of the moon reflecting the sun's light back to the sun. The moonlight need not illumine the sun, because the sun is shining with its own light a million times brighter than the moon. And not only that, moreover, the moonlight is nothing other than the sunlight. It is the sun's own light. So the sun blazes forth. Just that conjunction has to happen. Earth, moon, sun. Now in this case, the conjunction has to happen. You have to get it, what the Upanishad is trying to say. Just by the way, I heard a very nice simile about, or metaphor, about what the Upanishads are. Did you ever hear this? That the Upanishads are a burp? Deku, the great Marathi saint, Gyaneshwar, he says the rishis of the Upanishads, they stuffed themselves with self-knowledge. They filled their bellies with self-knowledge. They had a nice feast of self-knowledge. And they burped. And that burp was the Upanishads. So I am going to come down to say these are the expressions of the realizations of the rishis.<br><br> But I never thought that this most august and ancient and sacred of scriptures would be described as a burp. So all right. Now what happens? One more point to be noted. What exactly is the function of vritti-vyapti? What exactly is the function of phala-vyapti? In any knowledge, the function of vritti-vyapti is to destroy the ignorance about that object. So I want to know x. Right now I'm ignorant about x. Why? For example, what is behind me right now? Maybe you can see, but I can't see. So I need to, I'm ignorant about it, what is behind me. So in one way I can put it that what is behind me is covered by ignorance for me. How do I remove that ignorance? I have to create a vritti-vyapti. How do I create the vritti-vyapti? I have to look around and use my eyes and see what is there behind me. That creates a vritti about the thing which is behind me and it removes the ignorance about that. Simultaneously what happens is the reflected consciousness in the mind will illumine the revealed object and I will get the knowledge that I see what's there. So vritti-vyapti destroys ignorance, phala-vyapti reveals or illumines the object. I'll repeat again. Objects are hidden to us. The vritti-vyapti destroys the ignorance. Hidden by what? Hidden by ignorance. Vritti-vyapti destroys ignorance, phala-vyapti illumines the object.<br><br> Another example, dark room. You have a flashlight. Now the problem with the flashlight is it cannot illumine the whole room. You have only a beam of light. So to see things in the room you have to continuously focus that beam of light. That focusing is the vritti-vyapti. Just the focusing, that means just you turn the flashlight around this way and that way, that is creating the vrittis. And wherever the light falls, that is the phala-vyapti. So the light is absolutely essential but the light by itself will not reveal what you want to see. You need to focus it. And then you need to focus the instrument and then the light which is riding that instrument. Why I am using the riding because these are the terms used. Vritti-arudha-chaitanya. The consciousness riding the vritti. By the way, when I am talking about all of this, those who have studied Vedanta in depth, especially Vedanta paribhasa, there is a whole discussion about how the antarkarana vritti flows out and covers the object to be cognized and destroys the ignorance there. And the consciousness, reflected consciousness riding on that antarkarana vritti illumines the object so uncovered. I am not going into all of that. Not necessary. Just we need to understand what is going on in very practical and simple terms. So in the case of Brahma Jnana, vritti vyapti is necessary, phala vyapti is not necessary. This is a, you can see the power of these terms in a very short way, like a philosophical",
