    "a": " According to Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture on Vedantasara, the 12th president of the Ramakrishna Order, Bhutesanandaji, was asked if samadhi is necessary for enlightenment in Advaita Vedanta. His direct answer was no, but he clarified that it depends on the context. While samadhi is not a prerequisite for enlightenment, it can be a powerful tool for Vedantic meditation (nididhyasana) when integrated with Advaita Vedanta teachings.\n\nMichael Comans, in his work on the role of samadhi in Advaita Vedanta, criticizes the Ramakrishna Mission for overemphasizing samadhi. He argues that Shankara, a prominent figure in Advaita Vedanta, rarely discusses samadhi in his writings. Swami Sarvapriyananda acknowledges the complexity of the issue and explains that, over time, yogic practices of samadhi were integrated into Vedantic niridhyasana. This means that non-dualist monks practicing Advaita Vedanta incorporated Patanjali's Ashtanga yoga into their meditation practices to aid in their understanding of non-duality.\n\nIn summary, while samadhi is not strictly necessary for enlightenment in Advaita Vedanta, it can be a valuable tool for meditation and understanding when combined with Vedantic teachings. The integration of yogic samadhi practices into Advaita Vedanta occurred several hundred years ago and has since become a common part of the tradition.",

            "content": "It's been published now. So Bhutesanandaji was the 12th president of our order. He was asked, is samadhi necessary for enlightenment? His answer was direct one word, no. No. Then the question was, the follow up was, why do we ask this? Because we have read that Sri Ramakrishna, when he was taught Vedanta by by Totapuri, after that he attained nirvikalpa samadhi. And so we always, these two go in our minds together, Advaita Vedanta, nirvikalpa samadhi. This was asked to Bhutesanandaji. And then what was his reply? He said, That was not just Vedanta, Advaita Vedanta. You have to understand, there's elements of yoga were also present there. When he said after Vedantic teaching, you use meditation to attain samadhi, nirvikalpa samadhi. Good, that's yoga teaching and that's used by Vedantins. It's very powerful method for nididhyasana, Vedantic meditation. These two questions are sort of lost in all the discussions, but these are very important. When you have questions about the role of samadhi in enlightenment, is it necessary? Yes, but you must understand in what sense it is necessary. Practically, very much so. But not what you might think that after that kind of thing, then only I will become enlightened. No. All right. That's the rant. There have been papers written on it. I mean, there's a lot of background in my mind, why I'm saying these things. Papers written on it.<br><br> Michael Comans, for example, he says the role of samadhi in Advaita Vedanta, blaming us, the Ramakrishna Mission, for overemphasizing samadhi. He says, where in all of Shankara's writing, where does Shankara talk about samadhi? Almost never. So what are you guys talking about when you talk about samadhi? Now, why I'm saying this is, it's a very complicated issue. You will find in this book now, from now on, he will go on and on and on about samadhi. And he's not wrong. At one point, in the last thousand years or so, Vedantic shravana, manana, niridhyasana and samadhi, yogic practices of samadhi were integrated into Vedantic niridhyasana. So practically, it meant non-dualist monks spent a lot of their time, which was not in shravana and manana, in actual yogic practices, which looked indistinguishable from Patanjali yogic samadhi, at least from the outside. So what were they doing? They were incorporating the Ashtanga yoga of Patanjali to help them in Vedantic niridhyasana. That's what was going on. So you can see a lot of subtle points have to be clarified. Let me, all right, I'll start samadhi next time. I've given you the background. I'll just go through it. What is samadhi, the varieties of samadhi? You might ask, why are they discussing it here? Because of this. Traditionally, it had several hundred years ago, it became nicely integrated into Advaita Vedanta, Patanjali yoga practices as a part of Vedantic niridhyasana. Then the difference between samadhi and sleep, the actual practices of sitting and breathing and concentration, and what are the obstacles to samadhi and the removal, all this will come up. Let me quickly look at the points raised here. So, Shravani, among the concepts of Chidabhasa, Chit, Brahmakara Vritti, which one is what we call the self? All right, so these are the things that I can farm out to you all, you know,",
