    "a": " The main difference between Buddhist Shunyavada and Advaita Vedanta lies in their understanding of the self. In Advaita Vedanta, the self is considered to be the unchanging, permanent Atman, whereas in Buddhist Shunyavada, there is no such concept of an unchanging self. Instead, Buddhist Shunyavada posits the idea of Anatman or Anatta, which translates to 'no self' or 'no permanent self.'\n\nThis difference can be traced back to their views on impermanence. Advaita Vedanta acknowledges the existence of a permanent self that underlies the changing body-mind complex. On the other hand, Buddhist Shunyavada asserts that everything, including the body-mind complex, is impermanent and momentary, and therefore, there is no permanent self to be found.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that when we delve deeper into the philosophies, there are indications of shared truths between the two. For instance, when the Buddhist says, \"The body is not the self,\" the Advaitin would agree, asserting that \"You are not the body.\" Similarly, both philosophies agree that the mind, thoughts, feelings, and sensations do not constitute a permanent self.\n\nDespite their apparent differences, there is a belief that these contrasting viewpoints might be different linguistic approximations of the same truth. This notion arises from the observation that the language and ideas of the final developments of Buddhist philosophy, such as the Shunyavada of Nagarjuna, and Advaita Vedanta share striking similarities. However, it is important to remember that these philosophies originated from different traditions and developed through unique historical and cultural contexts.",

            "content": "I've got lots of questions. Yes. One of them is, I studied Buddhism for a number of years and I wondered whether you could briefly describe differences between the non-duality of Advaita Vedanta and the non-duality of Buddhism. Yes. It's a very good question to start with and a full answer would take a whole talk. All right, Tim. Do sit. You can come back again with other questions. I can see that you have a lot of good questions. Let's take this question first. You know, the reason this comes up, Buddhism, is Advaita Vedanta seems to say that, you know, the language used in Advaita Vedanta, you are the unchanging self. The Buddhist says just the opposite. There is nothing unchanging. Everything is change. The Buddha said, transient, transient, everything is transient. Impermanent, impermanent, everything is impermanent. Anityam, anityam, sarvam anityam. Not only impermanent, but also momentary. Things can be impermanent and they can last for a hundred years and then go. But Buddha said, no, no, no. Moment to moment. Kshanikam, kshanikam, sarvam kshanikam. Moment to moment, everything is changing. And therefore, shunyam, shunyam, sarvam shunyam. Emptiness, emptiness, all is emptiness. And because of impermanence, because of this momentariness, because of emptiness, dukkham, dukkham, sarvam dukkham.<br><br> Sorrow, sorrow, indeed all is sorrow. Now, in contrast to this, Advaita Vedanta seems to say that the self is not momentary, is not impermanent. The real self is permanent, the Atman. So, this is one fundamental difference. On the face of it, they seem to be just opposites. Advaita Vedanta talks about, in common with the Hindu philosophies, talks about the reality of the Atman, the self-theory. And the word used in Buddhism is Anatman, or in Pali, Anatta, or in Sanskrit, Anatman, no self-theory. So, are they not absolutely opposite? If you compare, one must realize that in Buddhism, there is a range of schools. There are various schools, the Sautrantika, the Vaibhashika, the Vijnanavada, the Shunyavada. In fact, in Tibetan Buddhism, are you asking from a particular Buddhist angle? The Tibetan Buddhist angle? No, I'm asking from the Shingon Buddhism. Alright. So, for example, the Tibetan Buddhism is philosophically a synthesis of Vijnanavada and Shunyavada. So, there are variations across the Theravada schools, across the Mahayana schools, across the Vajrayana, Tibetan Buddhist schools. It's interesting that when you come to Advaita Vedanta, what we are talking about, and one of the final developments of Buddhist philosophy, the Shunyavada of Nagarjuna, the language becomes extraordinarily similar. If you go to ancient Indian philosophy, the Hindus and the Buddhists debated this for nearly a thousand years. And it led to an extraordinary development of philosophy in India, on the Buddhist side and on the Hindu side. But I do believe that when you come to something like the Shunyavada, the Madhyamaka Shunyavada of Nagarjuna, and the Emptiness School of Nagarjuna, and the Advaita Vedanta, they seem to be very different. And if you go to the original texts, the dialectical texts, they seem to be attacking each other also. But there is enough reason to believe that there are different linguistic approximations of the same truth. How can, if you ask, it's nice to say that there are two aspects of the same truth, or two expressions of the same truth, but one might ask, how can you say no self and self are the same truth? But if one looks a little deeply, what does the Buddhist mean by no self? And what does the Vedantin mean by the self?<br><br> They are not talking about the same thing. When the Buddhist says, the body is not the self, there is no permanent self to be found in the body, the Advaitin agrees, you are not the body. The Advaitin does not say that the body is a permanent self. No, no, no. When the Buddhist says that mind, and thoughts, and feelings, sensations, they talk about five pillars, pancha skandha of existence, none of which, nowhere do you find a permanent self. The Advaitin would agree completely. What we just did, you are not the body, you are not the mind. All of it, the five skandhas of Buddhism are covered in this body-mind complex of Advaitin. And here, they both agree. Beyond the body-mind complex, underlying the body-mind complex, as the reality of",
