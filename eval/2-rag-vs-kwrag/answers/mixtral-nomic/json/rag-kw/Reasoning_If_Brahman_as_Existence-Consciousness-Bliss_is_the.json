    "q": "If Brahman as Existence-Consciousness-Bliss is the eternal subject that cannot be objectified, yet eternally reveals itself to give rise to apparent objects through the principle of Maya, can we infer that Brahman is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss-Maya? That is, is Brahman inseparable from Maya?",
    "c": "Reasoning",
    "k": "maya, brahman inseparable",
    "a": " According to Swami Sarvapriyananda's teachings, Brahman is not inseparable from Maya in the sense of being a combination of Existence-Consciousness-Bliss-Maya. Brahman is the absolute, unchanging reality, while Maya is the power of Brahman that projects the universe and all the apparent objects within it. Maya is often described as having two functions: veiling and projecting. Veiling makes us unable to directly perceive Brahman, while projecting makes us perceive the universe and all the objects within it, which are nothing but Brahman appearing differently through the lens of Maya.\n\nWhen Maya is associated with Brahman, it is called Saguna Brahman, which is often referred to as God in various religious traditions. Saguna Brahman is responsible for creating the universe, including all living beings and their minds, as well as the external universe.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Maya is not a separate entity from Brahman, but rather a power that Brahman possesses. Maya is not independent of Brahman, and it has no existence apart from Brahman. Brahman alone appears as the universe when viewed through the lens of Maya.\n\nTherefore, while Brahman and Maya are not the same thing, they are also not separate entities. Maya is a power that Brahman uses to project the universe, but it does not change or modify the nature of Brahman in any way. Brahman remains unchanged and eternal, while Maya is a dynamic and changing force that allows Brahman to appear as the universe.\n\nIn summary, while Brahman and Maya are not the same thing, they are also not separate entities. Maya is a power that Brahman possesses, and it is through Maya that Brahman projects the universe. However, Brahman remains unchanged and eternal, while Maya is a dynamic and changing force that allows Brahman to appear as the universe. Therefore, we cannot say that Brahman is inseparable from Maya in the sense of being a combination of Existence-Consciousness-Bliss-Maya.",

            "content": "same witness. This Brahman is supposed to have a power. Let's put it this way. What is this power? It's nothing different from Brahman. It is Brahman's power, like heat and light are the power of the flame. What it does is, it has two powers. It has two functions of this maya. This power is called maya. This maya has two powers of its own. Or two functions of its own. The two functions are called. Veiling. And two, projecting. Veiling and projecting. Veiling in Sanskrit. Aavarana or Aavriti. Here it's Aavriti. Aavarana. Projecting. Vikshema. Now what is projecting? It says. Brahman projects Brahman itself. Brahman itself. When viewed through maya.<br><br> Maya doesn't actually make something. It projects. It just projects Brahman itself as the universe. When viewed through the lens of maya. Brahman appears as the universe. What does it do? It first of all appears as subtle bodies. So here is a little fish. Then grows bodies. Here is a man. And here is the bird, the loon, which is absent. So here is a bird. And here is another man. Here is maybe a yogi. Sitting in meditation. And so on. So the subtle bodies and gross bodies. These are projected by maya. By what power? By the projecting power. The second one. The projecting power of maya. Makes Brahman appear first as the subtle bodies. Gross bodies. And the physical universe.<br><br> Mountains. Stars and planets. And so on. So the physical universe. In which of course included are the gross bodies. And subtle bodies. All of which actually have no existence apart from Brahman. It is Brahman alone appearing as all this. It is not Brahman being transformed into subtle bodies, transformed into physical bodies and stars and planets and atoms and quarks. No. It is Brahman alone. When you know it, know the world to what it is, you find Brahman. Brahman misunderstood is the world. The world correctly understood is Brahman. So maya is the power of Brahman? No, maya is the power of Brahman. Maya is the power of Brahman. Now, a quick point. Brahman plus maya is called saguna Brahman. The quality-less Brahman, pure Brahman, pure consciousness plus maya. Nirpuna Brahman. The quality-less Brahman. Nirpuna Brahman. Plus maya. Is called saguna Brahman.<br><br> What is the saguna Brahman? It is God. The God of religion. God of Ishwar. In every religion God is said to be the creator of the universe. Whichever religion is a theistic religion which talks about God as the creator of the universe. So according to Vedanta, we are not wrong. It is the same Brahman with the power of maya which is responsible for projecting the entire universe. All living beings, their minds and the external universe. Now, how does it work? Now, how does this work? Maya is capable of infinite divisions. Brahman is indivisible, akhanda. But maya is capable of infinite divisions. These divisions of maya, they become our ananda maya kosha. The experience that you get in deep sleep is this. Beyond it lies Brahman. Could you repeat that please Maharaj? These divisions of maya, these are our causal bodies. Causal body. Subtle body. Gross body. Causal body is karma. Causal body is maya, not karma. Causal body is maya, it is ignorance.<br><br> It is not theory here. It is what we experience in deep sleep. Look at our experience. We experience ourselves in three ways. One way is as a body here. Another way is internally, especially in dream, as a mind. And the third is in deep sleep, as a blankness. That blankness is a part of maya. Through that blankness, Brahman alone appears as a subtle body now, as a physical body and as external universe. That's why this maya is called the causal body. All the maya taken together is the power of Brahman. Brahman plus all the maya, follow this carefully. Brahman plus the total maya, total body. Brahman plus the total maya is Ishvara, Sarvada Brahman. Same Brahman, limited to one bit of maya, becomes a Jeeva. Or appears as a Jeeva. You are Brahman and God is also Brahman. But Brahman plus maya is God. Brahman plus a part of maya is us, each of us. Yes? Does that sound to be like a definition? Yes, it's a definition. That's how it's explained. It doesn't explain the reasoning. Up to a certain point, the reasoning holds.<br><br> Right. You are right. You have been following carefully. Up to this point, it was based on reasoning. Now, he is trying to explain the existence of this body. And he brings in scripture. There is something called Brahman which is the cause of the universe. What Vedanta is trying to tell us",
