    "a": " Sri Ramakrishna's teachings cannot be strictly categorized as purely Advaitic, even though he did teach and impart the knowledge of Advaita Vedanta, as demonstrated by his interactions with Totapuri. Sri Ramakrishna was known for his inclusiveness and acceptance of various spiritual paths as different ways to reach the same ultimate goal. He believed in and taught according to the principles of non-dualism (Advaita), dualism (Visishtadvaita), and qualified non-dualism (Dvaitadvaita).\n\nIn the passage you provided, Swami Sarvapriyananda explains that Sri Ramakrishna demonstrated and re-verified various spiritual practices and traditions, including Advaita Vedanta, Tantra, and Bhakti, among others. By embodying and experiencing these paths himself, he validated their effectiveness and showed that they could lead to enlightenment.\n\nThus, while Sri Ramakrishna did teach Advaitic principles and had a profound impact on Totapuri, his teachings encompassed more than just Advaita Vedanta. He emphasized that different spiritual paths could suit different individuals and that the ultimate goal of realizing one's true nature as the divine was accessible through various means.",

He says to Sri Ramakrishna, I see now who you are, let me go. Sri Ramakrishna says, no, I will not let you go. Until your mission coming here, until full Advaitic knowledge is attained, I will not let you go. So what is it that Totapuri sees suddenly? He saw a perfect disciple and he said, do you want to learn Advaita? And he says, let me go and ask my mother. You know the story, Sri Ramakrishna goes to the Kali temple and then comes back. Totapuri thought that he had gone to ask his own natural biological mother. Then he teaches him Advaita. As time goes by, Totapuri finds he cannot leave the place. He used to stay only three nights in every place. Then he begins to see that this is not just a great disciple, a wonderful perfect disciple who would get non-dual knowledge and he did get non-dual knowledge. Then he begins to see who this is. What is it that he sees? I think he sees Sri Ramakrishna is an avatar. One of those rare instances in history that Totapuri sees, oh, I have stumbled on this one. And his reaction is not devotion. He says, please let me go. And Sri Ramakrishna says, no. Until full Advaitic knowledge is attained. Now, who is full Advaitic knowledge? Who knows? Maybe it says that he is a disciple of a great person. Who is full Advaitic knowledge?<br><br> Who knows? It may be that he says that until you have transmitted all knowledge of Advaita to me, because that is why you have come here. Or it could be the other way around. The full-fledged Advaitic knowledge which you lack yet, that will be accomplished. The two things were accomplished here. Whenever all these masters came, the Ramayana sadhu, the Rama tradition, today's Ram Navami, who came with the baby Rama. Then Ram Lala. Then Bhairavi, who came with the vast knowledge of the tantras to Sri Ramakrishna. Then Totapuri, who comes with this Advaita Vedanta, classical Advaitic Vedanta knowledge. So all of these streams of spiritual practice, which were there, existing in and around that milieu in Sri Ramakrishna, they flowed through him and got re-verified, stamped with the fact that it works. In this day and age also, these are not old theories. You can become enlightened. He demonstrates to the highest possible extent in each one of them. He gives a tick mark. So the traditions are again regenerated. They are ancient traditions. So he is called Stapakaya Chadharma Sthya, Establisher of Dharma. What do you mean Establisher of Dharma? Dharma is already there. Establish in the sense that he injects new life and light into them. But the opposite is also true. Those who came to him, they were also fulfilled. They had something left, which is something they got from him and then they went away. So this is the idea. It might be a tendency to dismiss the avatar idea from the classical Advaitic perspective.<br><br> Avatar is fine with it. But then for a vast majority of people, the avatar is a powerful, is a gateway to enlightenment. Even for non-dualists, I have known of non-dualists who have got non-dual knowledge by meditating on Sri Ramakrishna. They were not trying to get non-dual knowledge. They are meditating on Ishta Devata and doing japa. And what realization did they get? Oneness of all existence and I am that. So it's a powerful gateway to whatever kind of enlightenment, whatever your path of spiritual practice.",
