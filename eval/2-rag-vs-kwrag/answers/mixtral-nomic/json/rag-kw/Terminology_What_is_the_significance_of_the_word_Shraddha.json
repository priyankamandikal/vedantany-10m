    "a": " The word 'Shraddha' in Swami Sarvapriyananda's teachings, particularly in the context of learning and understanding spiritual philosophies, holds a profound significance. It is often translated as 'faith' in English, but it goes beyond a simple belief or trust. Shraddha implies a deep sense of reverence, respect, and acceptance for the teacher, the teachings, and the texts. It is a feeling that there is truth in the teachings, even if one does not fully comprehend it yet.\n\nSwami Sarvapriyananda emphasizes that Shraddha is essential for any meaningful investigation or learning to take place. It is the foundation that allows one to approach the subject with an open mind and heart, ready to understand and learn, rather than to judge, criticize, or dismiss.\n\nIn the absence of Shraddha, one might quickly jump to conclusions, judge the teacher or the text, and create barriers to understanding. With Shraddha, one approaches the teacher and the teachings with humility, acknowledging that they have something valuable to learn, and seeking to bridge the gap between their current understanding and the teachings.\n\nIn summary, Shraddha is a deep feeling of reverence, respect, and acceptance for the teacher, the teachings, and the texts, which forms the foundation for meaningful learning and understanding in spiritual philosophies.",

            "content": "devotional approach where the idea is to cultivate love and faith in God. You cannot start by questioning there. It starts with Shraddha, with absolute acceptance. The existence of God, if you start by questioning it, then the path of devotion is not for you. Luckily in Hinduism, you have a spectrum of other paths. So if you don't accept the existence of God, it doesn't appeal to you or you question it, no problem. You can still have spirituality. You can have a yogic spirituality. You can have an Advaitic, the Jnani spirituality. These paths are open to you. In the Jnani's path, you must question. Clarity is very important at every step. And it's only through your questions that the teacher can teach. If Arjuna had no questions here, the Gita would be terribly short. Most of the Upanishads, you will see, they are dialogues. And the new teaching starts only when there is a question. So that's the point. The Buddhists have this terminology. Don't listen to a leaky pot, an upside down pot and a dirty pot. An upside down pot is that which does not retain anything. You try to pour water into it, just roll up the sides. So people come, listen. What did you hear? Oh, what do I know? All very high stuff, you know. The second one is the leaky pot.<br><br> So I come, I listen and I collect something. I feel I got something. But after some time, it's gone. I got something but I'm very vague about it now. I have to look into my notes and look at the YouTube talk again. It's a leaky pot. The third is a dirty pot. Dirty pot is already there's dirt inside. So whatever you put inside will be polluted. The skeptic, the one who is not aware of the world, whatever you put inside will be polluted. The skeptical approach in the sense that I know this is wrong. Now I'm trying to find out the ways in which this is wrong. One more little thing I'll add here. Something that I've noticed. See the traditional teachers insisted on Shraddha. And we don't really talk about that too much. Vivekananda gave great importance on Shraddha. Because in our modern approach, Shraddha means faith. A kind of deep sense of what this person says and what these texts say is true. But I don't get it yet. But it's true. There's something there. Let me go ahead. Without this, no investigation is possible. You can't sign up for a course in Columbia University if you don't have Shraddha on the syllabus and the text and the teacher.<br><br> If you say it's all wrong, why would you pay thousands of dollars and go to listen to something that's all wrong? So that kind of Shraddha is very necessary. And that's the least that we talk about. We don't talk about more than that. But much more than that is actually necessary. I'm seeing many different ways in which the deep Shraddha helps. And the lack of Shraddha obstructs us. Two examples I'll give you. Two levels. One level is, I don't have much Shraddha. And Shraddha in a sense is a deep feeling of reverence for the teacher and the material. But I'm curious. And I'm excited about this philosophy. The danger of that is, right at the beginning, I don't understand what's going on. But I really like it. It sounds cool. And because it's a matter of understanding, so very soon I begin to understand. If I really put some effort into it, if I read the books, listen to the talks, think about it, I begin to understand. Then I get a grasp, my own grasp, a foothold on the subject. And immediately, if there's a lack of Shraddha, what will happen is, I'll start judging the teacher and the text. Start finding faults with, you know, your understanding is not quite right. Let me correct you on this one. You might say, what's wrong with that? No, it's not. It's wrong.<br><br> Because the approach with Shraddha would have been, I don't understand what you said. This is my understanding. Could you help me from my understanding to what you have said? It's not only the polite way of approaching, it's the way with Shraddha. Without Shraddha, it's, I read it, I got it, and this person seems, now my teacher seems to be saying something different, so he's wrong. So, it's like, there's a story of an elderly person who was passing away, and his sons gathered around him. And he said, I have many people who borrowed money from me, and his sons quickly took down the notes. Father, tell us before you pass, whom did you borrow money from? Who borrowed money from you? We need to collect that.",
