    "q": "Is the waking state similar to a dream or absolutely indistinguishable from the dream state?",
    "c": "Explanatory",
    "k": "indistinguishable, dream state, waking state similar",
    "a": " According to Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture on Vedanta Retreat at Loon Lake, the waking state can be compared to a dream in the sense that both are temporary and illusory. The waking state is often referred to as the vyavaharika jiva, which is a transactional or relative empirical self that we experience ourselves to be. On the other hand, the dream state is referred to as the pratibhasika jiva, which is recognized after waking up to be an illusion or a dream.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial difference between the two states. While the dream state is experienced as less real and temporary, the waking state is experienced as more real and permanent. But from the ultimate standpoint of Vedanta, both the waking and dream states are illusory and not the absolute reality.\n\nWhen we wake up from a dream, the dream jiva, or the individual self in the dream, merges back into the waking jiva. Similarly, upon enlightenment, the waking jiva merges into the paramarthika jiva, which is the absolute or real self, also known as Brahman. This experience is said to be more powerful than waking up from a dream state.\n\nIn the Mandukya Upanishad, Gaudapada, Shankaracharya's teacher's teacher, states that we have only two states - dream and sleep. He considers the waking state to be a dream as well, and the reality to be beyond these states.\n\nTherefore, while the waking state and the dream state share some similarities, they are not absolutely indistinguishable from each other. The waking state is experienced as more real and permanent than the dream state, but from the ultimate standpoint of Vedanta, both are illusory and not the absolute reality.",

Waking Dreaming and sleeping Sleeping means deep sleep Of course, dream is also in sleep And we think we have these three states Deep sleep, dream and waking But Gaudapada Acharya, Shankaracharya's teacher's teacher says we have only two states Dream and sleep These two he calls dream And this he calls<br><br> sleep Only two states Only two states Dream and sleep Waking also he calls a dream And then, is there a real state when you get enlightened? He says yes, but that's not a state Reality is not a state States come and go Reality is what appears as these states So when we realize ourselves to be the Turiya The Brahman, the Paramarthika Jiva All of them are different terms for the same thing You, the reality After enlightenment Then you realize What we call the waking state is also a dream Just like the dreaming state And sleep is different from them Because in sleep we have no experience of any particular thing In dream we dream about things Waking we seem to experience with the help of sense organs But the reality of all of that is Brahman And we get enlightened, we realize that The holy mother Speaking to, I think, Arupananda Swami In Mayankathai, it's there She suddenly says Remember, Mahasarovar, he's saying In the rural setting in Bengal He's saying to this young monk Even this waking of ours is a dream And then the monk protests He says, how can this be a dream? Dreams are impermanent Every day it comes and it's gone Next time it's a new dream But the waking world is<br><br> there when you wake up And she doesn't argue She doesn't give arguments She just laughs, you know She laughs and she says in Bengali Taaholeva ba, tataaholeva Shakno bhoi toh no hai Let it be so, let it be more permanent The waking state, it is nothing other than a dream So, this analysis Now, one more point is there One example they have given for this Waking from dream to the waking state And from enlightenment from the waking state to Brahman The example he gives in this book At the very end of the book is Of foam It's not a very good example anyway Foam, wave and water In the ocean, the waters are whipped up into a wave And on the crest of the wave you see foam All of that is water When the foam subsides back into the wave, it's a wave The wave subsides back into water, it's water And of course, all throughout it was only water Now, the foam is like the dream jiva It is based on our waking",
