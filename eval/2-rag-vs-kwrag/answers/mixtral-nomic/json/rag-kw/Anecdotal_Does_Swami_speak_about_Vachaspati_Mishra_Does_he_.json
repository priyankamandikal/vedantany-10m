    "a": " Yes, Swami Sarvapriyananda does speak about Vachaspati Mishra and the origins of the Bhamati, which is one of the three key texts for understanding Adhyasa Bhashya and the debates arising from it, as mentioned in the passage.\n\nAccording to the story narrated by Swami Sarvapriyananda, Vachaspati Mishra, a scholar and spiritual seeker, had an encounter with his wife, Bhamati, after many years of marriage. He realized that he had not contributed much to her life, and as a token of his love and respect, he decided to name a book after her. This book came to be known as \"Bhamati,\" which is a commentary on Shankaracharya's Adhyasa Bhashya, a fundamental work in Advaita Vedanta.\n\nThe Bhamati is considered one of the three essential texts, along with Panchapadika Viva Rana and Ratnaprabha, for a deep understanding of Advaita Vedanta, particularly Shankaracharya's Adhyasa Bhashya. Swami Sarvapriyananda himself found the Bhamati fascinating when he first encountered it during his training days, appreciating the humility of Vachaspati Mishra as he compared his own work to the Ganga, being purified and elevated by its association with Shankaracharya's teachings.\n\nIn summary, Swami Sarvapriyananda does discuss Vachaspati Mishra and the story behind the creation of the Bhamati. The Bhamati is a significant text in the study of Advaita Vedanta, and Swami Sarvapriyananda highlights its importance in understanding the intricacies of Shankaracharya's teachings.",

            "content": "Everything is going on and you haven't even spoken to me. So, it's like some stories is 10 years, some stories is 40 years or whatever. And then Vachaspati was so taken aback. And he said, I haven't been able to give you anything at all in your life. I'm so sorry about that. And what's your name? He hasn't even asked her a name. Remember, this is old Indian arranged marriages. So, he didn't even know the name of his wife. What's your name? She said, Bhamati. And then he said, all right, I name this book Bhamati. And he said, as long as people shall study Advaita Vedanta, they study, there will be spiritual seekers in this world pursuing non-dualism. They will know your name as long as civilization persists. And that's true. I was just thinking, 1,200 years later, we are discussing Advaita Vedanta over Zoom, sitting here in Manhattan, and you're on all parts of the world, and we're still taking the name of Bhamati. Now, to bring you down from this very poetic, touching story, there's another version of the story that Vajaspati Mishra was probably living in a city called Bhamati. That's why he named it. But that doesn't sound so good. This story sounds better. And I heard it from a pundit. So, some credence. Why did I tell these stories? So, if you want to understand Advaita Vedanta in depth, the subtleties of it, the books you need to consult, the ancient books, are basically three. There are many, but three. One is Panchapadika Viva Rana.<br><br> Don't take down notes. They are all brain fryers. Panchapadika Viva Rana, that which comes from Padmapada, Padmapada Acharya down through Prakashatma, that sub-school, it's called Panchapadika, with Panchapadika Viva Rana. That's one. The second one is Bhamati of Vajaspati Mishra. That's two. The third one is much later, Govindananda, I think. It's called Ratnaprabha. Ratnaprabha. So, these are the three which one studies in order to understand Shankaracharya's Adhyasa Bhashya and all the debates arising out of it. I personally remember, I didn't know all this. When I came into, when I was in training, I came across a nice English translation of Bhamati. I can show you the book. I've got a copy. This is Bhamati of Vajaspati Mishra. And it's a nice English translation published in Chennai, the Adyar Library and Research Centre. And the foreword was given by none other than Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, who was a great philosopher, president of India and so on. And it was translated by S.S. Suryanarayan Shastri. This is just the Bhamati on Shankaracharya's commentary on the first four sutras, Chatus Sutri of Brahma Sutras. And there, I came across this book when I was a brahmachari and I started reading it. I didn't know what it was, but I found it fascinating. And the verses, Vajaspati Mishra writes to Shankaracharya here. One of them is so touching. He says, He says, Just as water from a dirty drain falls into the Ganga, and later becomes called Ganga water, is part of the Ganga, is purified and becomes part of the Ganga. Similarly, my worthless commentary, because it's connected to the Ganga of Shankaracharya, Shankaracharya's commentary, is also purified and elevated that way. And this term often used for Shankaracharya's writing, Vajaspati",
